                    Century Cars Hit the Road</font></h3>
                  <p><em>From on-board radar and Wi-Fi to electronic steering, 
                    amazing technologies already here or soon coming promise to 
                    create a new automotive era</em></p>
                  <p> Last year, General Motors (GM) made a splash with a concept 
                    car called Hy-wire that features Nintendo-style handgrips 
                    for steering, plus brakes and an accelerator that work electronically 
                    instead of via pressure from the driver's foot. Tired of driving? 
                    Hand the controls to your passenger for awhile. </p>
                  <p> That's pie in the sky for now, but come 2012 or 2015 a surprising 
                    amount of it may be for real. Cars will still have a steering 
                    wheel. They'll also probably still have a conventional gasoline 
                    engine instead of the Hy-wire's fuel-cell-and-hydrogen powerplant. 
                    Bernd Bohn, a top executive at Robert Bosch, the huge German 
                    auto-components company, recently predicted that internal 
                    combustion engines will still have 95% of the market in 2015 
                    and 85% in 2025. </p>
                  <p> <strong><font color="#CC9900">MORE PROMISE THAN EVER.</font></strong> 
                    Electronics will have replaced most mechanical systems, however, 
                    and even midrange models will be bristling with sensors, cameras, 
                    computer screens, and Wi-Fi connections -- the result of a 
                    new era in automobile technology that's just dawning. One 
                    indication of the changing times is that over the past two 
                    years Bosch has nearly tripled, <br>
                    to 300, the number of its development engineers working on 
                    driver-assistance systems, a fancy name for advanced electronics. 
                  </p>
                  <p> Another sign is the comparison drawn by John Heywood, director 
                    of the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute 
                    of Technology: &quot;I've been involved [with auto research] 
                    for more than 30 years, and there's more action and more promise 
                    for improvement now than I've ever seen.&quot; Among the advances 
                    that seem likely within the next decade: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Safety systems will move from passive protection, such 
                      as airbags, to active systems that use radar and cameras 
                      to watch for danger. &quot;We've put airbags just about 
                      every place you can,&quot; notes John Weiner, a U.S. product-planning 
                      manager at Toyota (TM ). &quot;Within the next five years, 
                      the car will use algorithms to anticipate hazards and intervene 
                      or warn the driver.&quot; </li>
                    <li> Car keys will be replaced by credit-card style systems 
                      already used in some Cadillacs, Infinitis, and BMWs. Already, 
                      says Michael Gautier, North American director of corporate 
                      technology for Siemens VDO Automotive, the auto components 
                      and systems unit of the German electronics giant Siemens 
                      (SI ), keyless entry is set to debut on some 40 different 
                      cars over the next three years. </li>
                    <li> Every new car will come with a computer-like screen mounted 
                      on the dash. It'll display a navigation system that uses 
                      a global positioning satellite plus onboard DVDs to provide 
                      directions, maps, and information on hotels, hospitals, 
                      and restaurants. The video screen also &quot;will show you 
                      certain features within the car and connect to other devices 
                      such as PDAs and cell <br>
                      phones,&quot; says Thilo Koslowski, San Jose (Calif.)-based 
                      lead vice-president in the automotive group for business-advisory 
                      firm Gartner G2. </li>
                    <li> Nearly every car will have a Wi-Fi hookup that automatically 
                      provides the weather, news, and other information. &quot;We're 
                      going to see hot spots in places like gas stations and restaurants,&quot; 
                      predicts Peter Wengert, a marketing manager for automotive 
                      products at Microsoft (MSFT ), which is pushing Windows 
                      Automotive as a software standard for handling the new communications 
                      functions in cars. </li>
                    <li> Cars will increasingly collect data that can be shared 
                      with dealers, manufacturers, and even other vehicles. Dealers 
                      or manufacturers, for instance, may do remote diagnostics 
                      to help troubleshoot a roadside breakdown. </li>
                    <li> Within 15 years, the average vehicle will be equipped 
                      with 10 to 15 cameras to help parents keep an eye on their 
                      kids and help drivers detect blinds spots, Siemens' Gautier 
                      predicts. Many cars may have cameras in the front bumper 
                      to &quot;see&quot; around corners as the driver eases out 
                      of a driveway or alley. </li>
                    <li> Cars with 40-volt electrical systems will become the 
                      standard because today's 12-volt systems can't easily accommodate 
                      all the new electronic gizmos. </li>
                    <li> Voice commands, already used in some BMWs, Jaguars, and 
                      Lexuses, will become far more common to help drivers juggle 
                      the proliferating functions in their cars. </li>
                    <li> Brake-by-wire and accelerate-by-wire -- where pressing 
                      the pedal sends an electronic signal rather than activating 
                      a physical connection to the engine or brakes -- will become 
                      common. All Mercedes models have used brake-by-wire since 
                      1994, and the Chevy Corvette and all recent Audis already 
                      have electronic gas pedals. Emergency-brake handles will 
                      be replaced by an electronic switch, as they have been already 
                      in many luxury cars. </li>
                    <li> Increasingly, cars will be programmable. &quot;We have 
                      a vision that you can use electronics to let you choose 
                      what kind of vehicle you want to drive,&quot; says Chris 
                      Gerdes, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford 
                      University. &quot;You can have it be sporty or luxurious, 
                      as you choose.&quot; </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> On the new Audi A8, each driver can program in not only 
                    his or her seat and steering-wheel settings but raise and 
                    lower road clearance to change the car's &quot;ride&quot; 
                    as well (see &quot;Tooling Around in Teutonic Technocars&quot;). 
                    Ron Miller, project leader for Intelligent Vehicle Technologies 
                    at Ford (F ), predicts that by 2010 most new vehicles will 
                    have reconfigurable speedometer and other displays with changeable 
                    type size -- for aging baby boomers who don't want to wear 
                    glasses while driving. &quot;Today it's probably a $400 option,&quot; 
                    Miller says. &quot;In a year or two it will be $200&quot; 
                    and will drop from there. </p>
                  <p> <font color="#CC9900"><strong><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/car.jpg" width="300" height="171" align="right">HOW 
                    MAY I HELP YOU?</strong></font> All of these changes will 
                    arrive at different times in different countries, in part 
                    because of geographic and cultural differences, among them 
                    the general litigiousness of American society. In the U.S., 
                    carmakers fear added legal liability if an accident occurs 
                    despite the intervention of a safety system. Rollover scares 
                    such as the Ford Explorer's will help boost the share of new 
                    vehicles sold in North America with electronic stability control 
                    systems -- which studies show save lives -- from 5% to 12% 
                    by 2005, Bosch estimates. But the figure is already 50% in 
                    Germany (where a tipsy Mercedes [DCX ] model scared drivers 
                    in 1997), 20% in France, and about 12% in Italy, Bosch figures. 
                  </p>
                  <p> The rush is on to build into cars many of the features now 
                    offered by GM's OnStar in-car communications system. OnStar, 
                    which has more than 2 million U.S. subscribers, delivers numerous 
                    services to their cars, from help in an emergency to weather 
                    reports and stock quotes. But it uses costly human operators 
                    to do much of the communicating, and it's expensive -- subscriptions 
                    cost $16.95 to $69.95 per month. </p>
                  <p> Rivals are hoping to automate OnStar-style services and 
                    offer them for free. In Germany, drivers can now sign up for 
                    a &quot;floating car data&quot; project, in which vehicles 
                    zap information to a computerized traffic-information center 
                    that alerts drivers if congestion is ahead, for example. </p>
                  <p> <strong><font color="#CC9900">TOO-AGGRESSIVE?</font></strong> 
                    Adding Wi-Fi capability to cars is a cheap way to vastly expand 
                    such capabilities -- and not just so drivers can get weather 
                    updates, sports scores, and e-mail. German auto makers envisage 
                    a distributed, car-to-car communications system in which vehicles 
                    will poll <br>
                    on-coming traffic and pass data from car to car and alert 
                    drivers up and down the highway to accidents and weather conditions, 
                    says Tobias Nickel, a BMW spokesman in Munich. An international 
                    consortium of auto companies and parts suppliers is already 
                    coming up with standards for such a system. </p>
                  <p> Meanwhile, so-called lane-departure warning systems are 
                    hitting the market in Japan. Typical is the one on the Inspire, 
                    an Accord-like Honda sold overseas with an optional &quot;collision 
                    mitigation system&quot; priced at $2,000 to $3,000. It warns 
                    a driver whose car goes over the white line and also has a 
                    radar system that monitors the traffic ahead. In a potential 
                    front-end collision, it flashes the lights, starts braking, 
                    and even executes a panic stop. </p>
                  <p> Rival automakers wonder how readily adaptable such systems 
                    are to the U.S. market. Michael Lembke, Audi's (VLKAY ) marketing 
                    director for North America, recently tested one Japanese system 
                    and contends that &quot;it has a lot of little things U.S. 
                    consumers wouldn't like.&quot; The intervention's aggressiveness 
                    might turn Americans off, for one. Also, U.S. road markings 
                    <br>
                    are far less uniform than in Japan, and the snowfalls in places 
                    like Minnesota and North Dakota far heavier. When J.D. Power 
                    &amp; Associates queried consumers about paying an extra $1,100 
                    or so for such systems, it found considerable price resistance, 
                    according to research director Jeremy <br>
                    Bowler. </p>
                  <p> <strong><font color="#CC9900"><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/car3.jpg" width="255" height="171" align="right">THIRST 
                    FOR POWER.</font></strong> Similarly, it isn't clear which 
                    new fuel-saving technologies will make the fastest inroads 
                    in the U.S. The industry is split over which way to go, with 
                    Japanese outfits mainly pushing hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, 
                    such as Toyota's Prius and Honda's Civic, while the Germans 
                    stress high-mileage diesel engines, which will have an estimated 
                    44% share of Europe's new-car market this year. (The Germans 
                    also plan to start selling hydrogen- and gasoline-powered 
                    hybrids domestically within three years, but hydrogen is unlikely 
                    to make a dent <br>
                    in the market for years to come.) GM and Ford, meanwhile, 
                    are planning for hybrids, diesel, and hydrogen models. </p>
                  <p> The key question may be whether the trend toward ever bigger, 
                    more powerful U.S. vehicles is finally peaking. Over the past 
                    15 years, computerized engine management and other new technologies 
                    have helped make engines 30% more efficient, the U.S. Environmental 
                    Protection Agency estimates. But average fuel efficiency has 
                    declined because the gains have been offset by the introduction 
                    of bigger engines to power ever larger SUVs and pickup trucks. 
                  </p>
                  <p> The average engine sold in the U.S. is now 165 horsepower, 
                    up 63% in the last 20 years, Siemens' Gautier notes. &quot;U.S. 
                    drivers love a sense of power, and that's not going to disappear,&quot; 
                    he adds. </p>
                  <p> <font color="#CC9900"><strong>SIMPLER TRANSMISSIONS.</strong></font> 
                    Even if vehicles and engines simply stay the same size, new 
                    technology can cut average fuel consumption by one-third by 
                    2020 and half by 2030, MIT's Heywood estimates. Hybrids and 
                    diesels will be an important factor. But most of the gains 
                    will come from wringing more efficiency out of gasoline engines. 
                  </p>
                  <p> Next year, GM plans to start phasing in engines that use 
                    a technology called &quot;displacement on demand,&quot; which 
                    cuts an engine's average fuel consumption by 8% by using only 
                    half its cylinders during most normal driving. GM expects 
                    2 million such engines to be in use by 2008. Engines with 
                    new, more advanced variable valve controls from BMW and other 
                    manufacturers will result in further fuel savings. </p>
                  <p> Another innovation is the continuously variable automatic 
                    transmission, which GM figures can cut fuel consumption by 
                    7% to 11%. These also have 45% fewer parts than conventional 
                    four-speed automatics and are now being offered on some Saturn 
                    and Audi models. </p>
                  <p> <strong><font color="#CC9900"><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/car2.jpg" width="350" height="158" align="right">MORE 
                    OOMPH.</font></strong> Bosch has developed yet another gas-hoarding 
                    device, a system that allows the engine to shut off when a 
                    <strong></strong>car is idling at a stop light or in traffic 
                    jams. Its new Directstart system can instantly restart the 
                    engine when the driver hits the gas pedal by igniting the 
                    combustion mixture in the fuel-injection system without engaging 
                    the starter motor. Bosch figures Directstart can cut a vehicle's 
                    fuel consumption by up to 5%. </p>
                  <p> Performance won't necessarily suffer. One advantage of diesel 
                    and electric engines is that they have high torque at low 
                    speeds -- quick pickup. Toyota's new Lexus RX 330 sport-utility 
                    vehicle, for instance, is the first hybrid with &quot;the 
                    performance of a V8 and the mileage of a compact car,&quot; 
                    Weiner says. Both GM and BMW are experimenting with small 
                    electric motors designed to save fuel while maintaining oomph 
                    by giving conventional engines a boost at low speeds. </p>
                  <p> Best of all, the innovative technologies may not force prices 
                    up much: The average new vehicle in the U.S now costs $25,400, 
                    including finance charges, yet the median income Americans 
                    spend on a new car has dropped to 20 weeks of pay, from 30 
                    weeks a decade ago, according to Detroit-based Comerica Bank. 
                  </p>
                  <p> <strong><font color="#CC9900">BIG DISTRACTIONS.</font></strong> 
                    Moreover, some of the latest technology takes cost out of 
                    a car. Electronic parking brakes may cost about the same as 
                    mechanical ones, but they take up less cabin space, thus giving 
                    designers new latitude, as well as having a safety advantage 
                    over handbrakes: They go on automatically when the car is 
                    idling or stopped on a hill. &quot;You reduce <br>
                    complexity and warranty [claims], add features, and because 
                    it's electronic it won't cost any more,&quot; says Ford's 
                    Miller. </p>
                  <p> The newest technologies do have some drawbacks. One is just 
                    how well a driver can concentrate in a car larded with CD 
                    and video players, navigation systems, cell phones, and other 
                    gizmos. Internet access -- which can be delivered via the 
                    navigation system screen -- is already <br>
                    coming to market in Japan and parts of Europe. &quot;We're 
                    technically capable of doing it today, [but] we truly believe 
                    it could be unsafe,&quot; says Audi's Lembke. &quot;We took 
                    it out of our cars because we felt it was pushing the limits 
                    of driver distraction.&quot; </p>
                  <p> Privacy issues will arise, too. If cars start to record 
                    and transmit data on things like speed, where the driver has 
                    been, and whether the wipers were on in a storm, then the 
                    family car could become a snitch on its driver. </p>
                  <p> <font color="#CC9900"><strong>DRIVERS STILL NEEDED.</strong></font> 
                    The new features will also test the limits of consumers' confidence 
                    in technology. For instance, replacing exterior rear-view 
                    mirrors with cameras would increase fuel economy by 3% to 
                    5% at highway speeds, Gautier says, but he calls the idea 
                    &quot;controversial.&quot; Would drivers accept seeing the 
                    road behind them partly via images on a screen? </p>
                  <p> Another key test is steering-by-wire. BMW is introducing 
                    the closest thing yet to such an option on its new 5-series 
                    sedans. It uses electronics and a planetary gear box to help 
                    with steering but also has a conventional steering system 
                    as a backup. Many experts expect steering columns to <br>
                    disappear eventually, though that will probably require regulatory 
                    approval. &quot;Most customers won't even know about it,&quot; 
                    contends Joseph Phillippi, head of AutoTrends Consulting in 
                    Short Hills, N.J. &quot;Only car buffs will know that there's 
                    no physical connection between the steering wheel and the 
                    front end.&quot; </p>
                  <p> Will cars ever drive themselves? Probably not for a few 
                    decades. Replacing humans is a tremendously complex software 
                    problem, Stanford's Gerdes says. &quot;Fully automated driving 
                    is one of those things that since the 1940s has always been 
                    15 years in the future,&quot; he adds. &quot;We never seem 
                    to get there.&quot; </p>
                  <p> That can wait. The changes that are just around the corner 
                    will be amazing enough. </p>
