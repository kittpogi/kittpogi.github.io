                  <p> The continuing demand to do more (sometimes with less) is 
                    physically exhausting and draining if not handled properly. 
                    Smart professionals recognise the early signs of burnout and 
                    deal with it.</p>
                  <p>By <em>Jonathan Poe</em> - Meta Group<br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="../../vol5/no3/images/burnout.jpg" width="144" height="144" align="right">Many 
                    senior staffers find themselves overly committed, emotionally 
                    drained and stressed. These feelings are often accompanied 
                    by physical manifestations such as health problems, sleepless 
                    nights, high blood pressure, and food cravings. Although (real 
                    or perceived) short-term pressures are good for stretching 
                    people's capabilities, long-term exposure without coping mechanisms 
                    usually results in physical, professional, or partnership 
                    fatalities. Top-notch CIOs are vigilant for terminal fatigue 
                    and fatal flaws, ways of thinking, judging, analysing and 
                    executing. </p>
                  <p> Currently, 75 percent or more of IT professionals experience 
                    significant levels of stress in their individual, departmental, 
                    or corporate performance. This number has been fairly constant 
                    during the past several decades, and our research indicates 
                    no decline is forecast through 2010. Through 2005, 15 percent 
                    or more of IT professionals will leave the profession because 
                    of this resultant stress, loss of control, lowered self-esteem, 
                    or fatigue. However, through 2006, a select group of IT practitioners 
                    (30 percent) will make concerted efforts to reform, restore, 
                    and re&shy;balance their lifestyles for more balance and longevity. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The good news about burnout is that it can be avoided. Handling 
                    stress is a best practice among long-term IT professionals. 
                    Our research uncovers the following seven practical guidelines 
                    for preventing burnout and increasing lifetime productivity:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Periodically stop, step back, and reflect for 
                      a few moments.</strong> Spending a few moments alone in 
                      quietness has long been a best practice. It enables people 
                      with great responsibility to see the bigger picture, refocus, 
                      reset priorities, refresh themselves, and ensure realistic 
                      and achievable objectives. Experienced managers exploit 
                      these rest stops to pace themselves and their teams. World-class 
                      executives allocate time and energy to do this activity 
                      daily. <br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Balance physical, mental, and emotional activities.</strong> 
                      Wellness programmes have long been part of high-performing 
                      (people-friendly) firms and the practice of long-tenured 
                      professionals. Wellness programmes can also create informal 
                      networks of people (increase personnel connectivity) and 
                      lower corporate bureaucracy (speed corporate information 
                      flow). Office personnel frequently take brisk walks at lunch 
                      and stretch between telephone calls. Healthy lifestyles 
                      require balanced diets, exercises, rest, and thinking. Skilled 
                      executives plan and execute balanced regimes weekly. <br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Take short breaks throughout the workday.</strong> 
                      Whether it is to get a drink of water, deliver a memo by 
                      hand, or manage by walking around, physically moving away 
                      from the one's immediate work environment breaks up the 
                      mundane aspects of work (&quot;administrivia&quot;) and 
                      enables seeing different perspectives on work. By physically 
                      changing the environment, accomplished professionals know 
                      that mental and emotional states also change. Short breaks 
                      also enable managers to think about how the work should 
                      be done (possibly increasing speed) versus just blindly 
                      following a checklist (aged procedures). Managers perform 
                      their best when able to think and plan work daily versus 
                      succumbing to the constant environment of interruptions. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Have a non-work passion.</strong> Similar to having 
                      catalysts to push and pull a person to work, there should 
                      be external passions to pull and push a person from work. 
                      Often, experimentation in non-work passions creates reusable 
                      tools, knowledge, and techniques for work. Although non-work 
                      passions require equal mental concentrations, they are often 
                      easier to step back from and in doing so enable practitioners 
                      to reuse this technique (and others) at work. Non-work passions 
                      also teach individuals how to manage multiple projects in 
                      parallel with less work risk. <br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Take regular vacations.</strong> Long periods 
                      away from work reduce stress, build new neural pathways, 
                      and create small-talk artefacts that make Type A or extremely 
                      competent professionals more humane and easier to relate 
                      to (increases credibility). Vacations generate gifts, souvenirs, 
                      and artefacts (pictures, memorabilia) that start casual 
                      conversations, which improves business relationships. Taking 
                      regular vacations also reinforces &quot;walking the talk&quot; 
                      and ensuring that team-mates and subordinates take vacations 
                      to prevent their burnouts. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/aquarium.jpg" width="216" height="168" align="right">Inject 
                      humour, fun, and a positive outlook into work.</strong> 
                      Although laughter and humour provide brief moments of relief, 
                      fun generates passion and balanced perspectives. Mastery 
                      of humour and fun creates executives who are more memorable 
                      and who enjoy large followings. Fun also motivates people 
                      to tackle harder jobs. Positive outlooks dispel gloom, enable 
                      dealing with Murphy's Law, and support staying with time-tested 
                      processes when answers are not readily apparent at the start. 
                      Positive outlooks also serve as catalysts to new ideas and 
                      innovative thinking. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Seek support.</strong> No one is perfect. Everyone 
                      has limitations. Similar to how teams can accomplish more 
                      than one individual, experienced professionals have support 
                      teams to refresh themselves and their tools, methods, and 
                      attitudes. One of the singular moments in a person's career 
                      is when he or she moves from being one-dimensional to multidimensional. 
                      Instead of always starting from scratch, learned scholars 
                      build on the mistakes of and lessons learned by others. 
                      Drawing on communities of practice, knowledge and interest 
                      saves time, energy and effort.<br>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>CIOs and their directors are attentive for burnout in themselves 
                    and their staffs. By following the aforementioned seven simple 
                    habits, IT professionals revive and thrive. As technologies 
                    and customer expectations rapidly evolve, street-smart individuals 
                    develop their mechanisms for coping, understanding and transforming. 
                    The alternative, burnout, is unacceptable to most high-performing 
                    individuals. </p>
