                  <h2><font color="#CC9900">A Little Linux History 
                    Lesson</font> </h2>
                  <p><em><strong>By Dave Kearns</strong></em> </p>
                  <p>Today we're going to look at Linux. Not as a competitor to 
                    Windows and not as a repository of proprietary code (as SCO 
                    would have you believe), but as an alternative operating system 
                    <br>
                    that might have a place in your network. </p>
                  <p>Like most overnight sensations, Linux was many years in the 
                    making. Its history is generally traced to 1991 but is rooted 
                    in the older Minix operating system. </p>
                  <p>Minix was a Unix-like system developed by Andrew Tannebaum 
                    (of the Vrije Universiteit in Holland) for students of his 
                    operating systems courses. It was small and somewhat idiosyncratic 
                    but did <br>
                    run on an Intel 8086 platform and the source code was published 
                    in Dr. Tannebaum's textbook. The book became an underground 
                    bestseller among computer programmers worldwide, one of whom 
                    was <br>
                    a 21-year-old Finnish student at the University of Helsinki 
                    named Linus Torvalds. </p>
                  <p><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/linux.jpg" width="216" height="74" align="right">On 
                    Aug. 25, 1991, Torvalds announced that he was beginning work 
                    on a new system, based on Minix but to be released under the 
                    GNU license (we'll get to GNU next week) so that anyone could 
                    acquire the source code, modify it and re-release it. </p>
                  <p>In 1991, DOS was king (Windows 3 was in beta) in the Intel 
                    world. Unix (called Ultrix, SunOS, AIX and other proprietary 
                    names) was offered by hardware manufacturers for their own 
                    platforms, but not others. There were Unix-like systems for 
                    Intel, such as FreeBSD (based on the University of California's 
                    Berkley Software Distribution version of Unix) and the Santa 
                    Cruz Operation's Xenix (which was originally developed by 
                    a small company called Microsoft back in 1980). But these 
                    were <br>
                    basically niche products, used most by applications vendors 
                    to sell &quot;black box&quot; turnkey systems to non-technical 
                    commercial users. </p>
                  <p>Torvalds kept a strong hold on the kernel of Linux while 
                    allowing others to develop around it and suggest possible 
                    improvements (and even work on them). By the mid-1990s, thousands 
                    of hackers (in the best sense of the word) worldwide were 
                    contributing to Linux and tens of thousands of users were 
                    running it on Intel platforms. This was partially a reaction 
                    to Windows (some people just have to get &quot;under the hood&quot; 
                    and use the command line) but also a reaction to the seemingly 
                    unstoppable march of Microsoft across the face of computing. 
                  </p>
                  <p>When researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory used Linux 
                    to run 68 PCs as a single parallel processing machine in 1996, 
                    they were, in effect, building the equivalent of a million 
                    dollar supercomputer for about $150,000. That got the attention 
                    of enterprise computer users and gave rise to the commercial 
                    Linux distributions from Red Hat, SuSE and others. Today, 
                    Linux is the <br>
                    fastest growing operating system in history. Read more at 
                    &lt;<a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/rhasan/linux/" target="_blank">https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/rhasan/linux/</a>&gt; 
                    about the history of this &quot;guerrilla marketed&quot; (look 
                    that one up) operating system. </p>
                  <p>While many tout Linux as a replacement for Microsoft operating 
                    systems, both on the server and on the desktop, most of you 
                    aren't quite ready to take that step. There's no need to do 
                    that, anyway. Heterogeneous networks, with multiple operating 
                    systems, are the norm rather than the exception. Look at your 
                    own network - is everyone running the same version of the 
                    same operating system on their desktop? Also, since Linux 
                    was specifically developed for Intel platforms, it runs best 
                    on the <br>
                    computers you already own. </p>
                  <p>The best use of Linux is as a server system running resource 
                    intensive applications. Proxy servers, firewalls, Web services, 
                    databases, even e-mail (with resource-intensive spam and virus 
                    protections) could be cost-effectively run on a Linux platform. 
                    Next issue, we'll look at some specific applications for a 
                    Linux box on your Windows network. </p>
                  <p><em>The Graduate School of the College of Computer Studies 
                    started using Minix in 1989. ITC has been using Linux since 
                    1994.</em></p>
