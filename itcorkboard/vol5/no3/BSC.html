                  <p> Many organizations have had the experience of investing 
                    significant time and money to roll out a new initiative or 
                    develop a new process, only to see it fail within the first 
                    months. Too many of these failed efforts in an organization 
                    tend to lead to a &quot;fad of the month&quot; syndrome where 
                    <br>
                    employees lose faith in an organization's commitment to execute 
                    change. This is why it is so critical to put the right success 
                    factors in place when beginning the Balanced Scorecard journey. 
                    One such key to success is the Balanced Scorecard Change Agent. 
                    In this article, learn about the role of a successful Balanced 
                    Scorecard Change Agent, and how organizations have used this 
                    approach to drive results with their Balanced Scorecard implementation. 
                  </p>
                  <h3> <font color="#CC9900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/scorecard.jpg" width="180" height="176" align="right"></em>What 
                    is a Balanced Scorecard Change Agent?</font> </h3>
                  <p> A Balanced Scorecard Change Agent is the individual in an 
                    organization who makes change happen through the Balanced 
                    Scorecard and Strategy-Focused Organization Frameworks. More 
                    specifically, a BSC Change Agent is the individual within 
                    an organization who has the job of, first, leading the Balanced 
                    Scorecard design and development effort, and, second, using 
                    the Balanced Scorecard framework to manage leadership processes 
                    and drive change on an ongoing basis. While the BSC design/development 
                    effort must be carried out well for success to happen, it 
                    is the second effort that ultimately drives success for the 
                    organization. It is during this second phase that the Change 
                    Agent makes sure that the effort shifts from &quot;Balanced 
                    Scorecard project&quot; to ongoing &quot;Strategy-Focused 
                    Organization transformation&quot;. </p>
                  <p> BSC Change Agents go by a variety of titles, from &quot;BSC 
                    Manager&quot; to &quot;Transformation Leader.&quot; While 
                    the title often reflects the culture of the BSC organization, 
                    it may also say a great deal about the commitment of the organization 
                    to stay the course with the BSC as a sustainable change vehicle. 
                  </p>
                  <p> BSC Change Agents are brought into the role (or create the 
                    role) from a variety of backgrounds. We often observe Change 
                    Agents from Finance, Strategic Planning, Quality, Internal 
                    Consulting, Information Technology, and Human Resources. But 
                    Change Agents can also surface from Line <br>
                    Operating and Marketing roles. </p>
                  <p> While Change Agents can be from the organization's executive 
                    team, including the CEO, most often they volunteer or are 
                    assigned from the areas mentioned above. However, whatever 
                    the source, the Change Agent's success largely depends on 
                    a close partnership with a top executive. The most successful 
                    BSC organizations can demonstrate a lasting team relationship 
                    between a C-level executive and the Change Agent. Examples 
                    include Bob McCool (President) and Ed Lewis (CA) at Mobil, 
                    Gerry Isom (President) and Tom Valerio (CA) at CIGNA P&amp;C, 
                    and Scott Goodspeed (President) and Kathy Lucy (CA) at Anna 
                    Jacques Hospital. </p>
                  <h3> <font color="#CC9900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    Role of the Balanced Scorecard Change Agent </font></h3>
                  <p> The Change Agent has a number of shifting roles during the 
                    lifecycle of the Balanced Scorecard journey. While it is optimal 
                    to have one individual fill all of these roles, in many organizations 
                    two or more people have successfully filled these roles. The 
                    four primary roles are: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Missionary </li>
                    <li>Consultant </li>
                    <li>Point Person </li>
                    <li>Chief of Staff </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> <img src="../../vol5/no3/images/scorecard2.jpg" width="163" height="86" align="right">The 
                    Missionary is the individual who advocates and &quot;sells&quot; 
                    the Balanced Scorecard and Strategy-Focused Organization concepts 
                    into the organization at the beginning of the journey. While 
                    this Missionary role can be played by an individual at the 
                    top, for example Dr. Peter Person, CEO of Saint Mary's/Duluth 
                    Clinics Health System, more often the Missionary is someone 
                    deeper within the organization who has learned about the BSC, 
                    realized that it will fill a strategic need, and brought the 
                    concept to the attention of leadership. </p>
                  <p> At one large regional bank in the Mid Atlantic, a line manager 
                    in the Retail Division read about the BSC and instinctively 
                    knew that the framework could help his organization. He then 
                    researched the concept heavily and got the attention of an 
                    Executive VP. Together they decided to bring BSC to the attention 
                    of the Executive Committee. To do this, they contacted Dr. 
                    Robert Kaplan, co-author of the concept and Chairman of Balanced 
                    Scorecard Collaborative (BSCol), who provided them with advice 
                    on how to proceed. They then worked with BSCol to design a 
                    BSC development program, convince the Executive Committee 
                    to buy-in, and launch the journey. This missionary process 
                    took about six months of persistence and constant learning 
                    and education. </p>
                  <p> The above example demonstrates that, while the Missionary 
                    role can at times be exploratory and time consuming, if successful, 
                    it will contribute to true change within the organization. 
                  </p>
                  <p> The Consultant is the individual who designs the Balanced 
                    Scorecard/Strategy-Focused Organization development and rollout 
                    &quot;project&quot;. This individual does everything from 
                    scheduling interviews and workshops to &quot;evangelizing&quot; 
                    and educating, to troubleshooting and keeping the <br>
                    organization motivated. While the framework of the BSC is 
                    so elegantly simple, the detailed process of developing and 
                    implementing a BSC has many steps that must be tightly orchestrated 
                    for success to occur. Therefore, the BSC Consultant must be 
                    both an exacting project manager and a trusted advisor. </p>
                  <p> The Program Manager at a large global medical technology 
                    company realized that he had to create a BSC &quot;Center 
                    of Excellence&quot;. In other words, he had to create a system 
                    (both electronic and manual) to manage all of the rich and 
                    varied content, process steps, and knowledge management that 
                    are all part of a successful BSC program. He became both &quot;command 
                    central&quot; and &quot;global archives&quot; in the eyes 
                    of his organization. He also became an expert as a &quot;strategic 
                    process design engineer,&quot; a critical role in building 
                    the BSC-centric Strategy-Focused Organization. These processes 
                    included <em>Strategic Planning, Budgeting, Strategic Communications, 
                    Performance Management, and Governance</em>. </p>
                  <p> The Point Person is the individual whose role is to keep 
                    up the momentum necessary for a Balanced Scorecard program, 
                    or any large process change, to take place. This person must 
                    be both a &quot;trouble shooter&quot; and a relentless &quot;enthusiast&quot;. 
                    This individual must look for pockets of <br>
                    resistance and find creative but forceful ways to overcome 
                    them. He/She must have a close working relationship with the 
                    BSC executive champion or leadership team in order to get 
                    problems solved and ensure the necessary resources to make 
                    change happen. And, at times the Point Person must challenge 
                    the executive team to keep up the momentum. </p>
                  <p> Kathy Lucy, the Change Agent at Anna Jacques Hospital, a 
                    120 bed hospital in Newburyport, MA, is extremely successful 
                    in this role. She is relentlessly persistent in her drive 
                    to make the BSC process successful, and yet uses humor and 
                    tact to convince her leadership to stay the course. To this 
                    end, she calls and enforces regular BSC meetings, structures 
                    regular data updates, and provides strategic insights resulting 
                    from the BSC. </p>
                  <p> The Chief of Staff is the individual who makes all of the 
                    pieces come together to form a sustainable integrated management 
                    system for the organization. While there is a great deal of 
                    role overlap with the Point Person, the Chief of Staff is 
                    the individual who manages ongoing strategic process improvement 
                    and adherence to the BSC framework. The Chief of Staff makes 
                    the BSC a &quot;way of life&quot; to ensure the future success 
                    of the organization. </p>
                  <p> Ed Lewis, during his long and effective tenure as BSC Change 
                    Agent at Mobil North American Marketing &amp; Refining, made 
                    sure that every individual, from top to bottom understood 
                    that the BSC was the way to manage at Mobil. He made sure 
                    that the framework became the backbone for all key processes 
                    from strategic planning to communications to performance compensation. 
                    His work contributed greatly to sustainable market success 
                    at Mobil.</p>

                    Balanced Scorecard Change Agent Attributes and Preparation</font> 
                  </h3>
                  <p> While different individuals can take on each of the above 
                    roles in an organization, the best results often occur when 
                    one individual can take on the role of Change Agent throughout 
                    the life cycle of the BSC design and execution. This continuity 
                    in turn supports a consistent and well-integrated BSC experience. 
                    However, as long as the right individuals are put in place 
                    at each of these stages, the organization stands a greatly 
                    increased chance of long-term success. </p>
                  <p> <em><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/scorecard3.jpg" width="211" height="180" align="right">So, 
                    what does it take to be a successful Change Agent?</em> We 
                    have observed a number of key capabilities:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> 
                      <div align="left"> Qualitative/Communications skills </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>Quantitative skills </li>
                    <li>Synthesis skills </li>
                    <li>Role coordination </li>
                    <li>Organizational networking </li>
                    <li>Problem solving </li>
                    <li>Tenacity </li>
                    <li>Persuasiveness </li>
                    <li>Curiosity </li>
                    <li>Decisiveness </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>It is the rare individual who can master all of these capabilities. 
                    And, yet, the BSC is all about strategy execution which is 
                    a program of massive proportions and scope. </p>
                  <p> <em>What does the Change Agent need in the way of preparation 
                    and access to be successful?</em> We focus on four areas:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Solid training in the concepts and methodology of the 
                      BSC and SFO </li>
                    <li>Clear understanding of the organization's current BSC 
                    </li>
                    <li>Access to and training in BSC data sources and reports 
                    </li>
                    <li>Access to and active participation in leadership discussions 
                      on BSC content</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>It is pretty difficult to manage the processes of strategy 
                    design and execution without the above areas. This point reinforces 
                    the need for the Change Agent to partner with and have the 
                    full support of an executive champion.</p>

                    transformation to become a Strategy-Focused Organization.

                  <p> <em>During the design phase</em>:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li> <strong>Get the idea in front of people</strong> - Be 
                      persistent in researching the concept. Make sure to have 
                      conversations with everyone you can reach in your organization 
                      about the BSC. Provide articles and other readings to key 
                      decision makers. </li>
                    <li><strong>Use references</strong> - There are many people 
                      around the world and in all industries who have wonderful 
                      things to say about the Balanced Scorecard. Take advantage 
                      of their insights to get your point across. </li>
                    <li><strong>Get the scope and definition right</strong> - 
                      Many individuals misunderstand the Balanced Scorecard concept 
                      and scope. Be sure that everyone in your organization is 
                      talking about the same thing - a framework for strategically 
                      managing your organization, not just a measurement dashboard. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Develop organization-specific examples</strong> 
                      - Move from theory to real organization examples quickly; 
                      it helps get your ideas across. Get a BSC started in a pilot 
                      department for &quot;proof of concept.&quot; </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><em>During the execution phase:</em> </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Schedule meetings and events</strong> - &quot;Stick-to-it-ivness&quot; 
                      is critical here. Keep the momentum going by scheduling 
                      regular BSC management and communications meetings. Make 
                      sure that the Strategy Map is used in all events. </li>
                    <li><strong>Make BSC part of all processes</strong> - The 
                      most successful BSC organizations have integrated the framework 
                      into all strategy management processes (strategic planning, 
                      budgeting, organizational communications, individual performance 
                      management and incentives, and governance). </li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate often</strong> - Don't ever assume 
                      that the &quot;job is done.&quot; It requires an ongoing 
                      effort to make the BSC a way of life in any organization. 
                      Constant and reinforced communication is a must. </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p> In summary, the Balanced Scorecard Change Agent role is 
                    a rich and complex one, requiring a variety of capabilities, 
                    skills, and partnerships. However, if it is done well, and 
                    if the Change Agent stays the course, the rewards can be outstanding 
                    both for the organization and the individual.</p>
