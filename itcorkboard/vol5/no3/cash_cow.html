                    another workday draws to a close in Phoenix, some 20 adults 
                    hurry from their offices to a marketing course at a nearby 
                    university. But rather than meet on a leafy campus, they head 
                    to class in a spartan, leased office building out by the airport. 
                    Their school: the University of Phoenix, the nation's largest 
                    private university, with 96,000 students scattered among 134 
                    satellite locations across 28 states. Instead of tenured faculty, 
                    over 95% of the university's lecturers are working professionals 
                    who teach only part-time. George Francisco, for example, a 
                    23-year veteran of Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) who now runs his 
                    own food-brokerage firm, is the marketing instructor. Nor 
                    are the students primarily 18- to 24-year-olds. Like tonight's 
                    class, they tend to be working adults in their 20s and 30s 
                    who are looking to get ahead by finishing a B.A. or earning 
                    an advanced degree.</p>

                    Something else sets the University of Phoenix apart from most 
                    other colleges: It's in business to make money, and it's doing 
                    so in spades. In the year ended Aug. 31, earnings of parent 
                    Apollo Group Inc. (APOL ), surged 53%, to $247 million, as 
                    revenues jumped by a third, to $1.3 billion. Such stellar 
                    performance has given Apollo a market value of $11.4 billion 
                    -- equal to the endowment of Yale University, the nation's 
                    second-wealthiest college.</p>
                  <p> Phoenix is the most prominent of a controversial new generation 
                    of  
                    for-profit colleges that are emerging as a dynamic new force 
                    in higher  
                    education. As traditional universities struggle with soaring 
                    costs and  
                    plunging taxpayer subsidies, the 10 largest publicly listed 
                    for-profits  
                    have already grabbed more than a half-million students. Add 
                    the hundreds  
                    of smaller players, and overall for-profit enrollment will 
                    jump by 6.2%  
                    this year, or five times the pace at conventional colleges, 
                    according to  
                    Boston market researcher Eduventures Inc. That will push the 
                    industry's  
                    revenues to $13 billion this year, up 65% since 1999.</p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#CC9900"><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/diploma.jpg" width="144" height="148" align="right">How 
                    are they doing it?</font></em> Largely by catering to the 
                    voracious appetite for college-level skills among groups neglected 
                    by conventional higher-ed institutions. While most colleges 
                    fight furiously over the top 25% of high school graduates, 
                    for-profits aim for the middle half of the class. They also 
                    target working adults hungry for technical and professional 
                    skills, including many lower-income ones. Even without affirmative 
                    action, almost half of for-profit students are minorities.</p>
                  <p> To capture these booming markets, schools such as Phoenix 
                    are changing  
                    the definition of what it means to be a college. Rather than 
                    recreate  
                    the Ivory Tower, they treat students like customers whose 
                    goal is to get  
                    a job or a promotion. So students are willing to shell out 
                    the $11,000  
                    or so a year the typical for-profit charges -- less than the 
                    $20,000  
                    tuition at private colleges but more than twice that of the 
                    average  
                    public university.</p>
                  <p> Programs are designed with the job market -- and customer 
                    needs -- in  
                    mind. Most are highly focused on a particular skill or subject 
                    area.  
                    They also meet at times and locations that are convenient 
                    for students,  
                    who can keep working while they study. Many companies value 
                    a for-profit  
                    education, too: 60% of Phoenix students get tuition reimbursement 
                    from  
                    their employers. By bringing basic business precepts such 
                    as customer  
                    service and cost controls to the college classroom, for-profits 
                    are  
                    spearheading educational innovations that are likely to be 
                    increasingly  
                    copied by their nonprofit counterparts.</p>
                  <p> Critics charge that for-profits succeed by commercializing 
                    higher ed.  
                    Certainly, Phoenix and its brethren make no pretense of providing 
                    a  
                    classic liberal arts education. Most are stripped-down, sterile 
                    places,  
                    a far cry from ivy-covered campuses and football teams. They 
                    also have  
                    done away with many hallmarks vital to great universities, 
                    from pricey  
                    research labs to purely academic subjects such as philosophy 
                    and  
                    linguistics.</p>
                  <p> Still, by delivering marketable skills and helping students 
                    to complete  
                    a degree, the best for-profits provide a service that's largely 
                     
                    unavailable elsewhere. &quot;They're not about to supplant 
                    the finest  
                    educational institutions in the country, but they add to the 
                    array of  
                    choices students have,&quot; says Yale University President 
                    Richard Levin.</p>
                  <p> <strong><font color="#CC9900">NICHE STRENGTH</font></strong> 
                    Long term, for-profits may even challenge traditional universities' 
                    dominance in some areas. So far, most gains have come from 
                    students who probably wouldn't have gone to a conventional 
                    college. But more and more, they're stealing those who might 
                    have. Already, 10% of MBA candidates attend a for-profit, 
                    up from 2% a decade ago. Ross University's 2,000-student medical 
                    school -- located on the island of Dominica because the U.S. 
                    medical Establishment won't accredit for-profit med schools 
                    -- graduates more M.D.s than any school in the U.S. (Virtually 
                    all are Americans who return home to practice.)</p>
                  <p> For-profits also have grabbed 41% of the $3.5 billion online-degree 
                     
                    market, which has tripled since 2000, according to Eduventures. 
                    They're  
                    aggressively expanding in foreign countries, too, targeting 
                    eager  
                    students from Chile to China. John G. Sperling, Phoenix founder 
                    and  
                    chairman of Apollo Group, predicts that as it rolls out online 
                    courses  
                    in developing nations, Phoenix could become the largest university 
                    in  
                    the world. Meanwhile, Career Education Corp. (CECO ) plans 
                    to raise its  
                    enrollment in the U.S. and abroad, to 250,000 over the next 
                    few years.  
                    &quot;Smaller schools and those that don't serve student needs 
                    are going to  
                    get buried,&quot; says Career Education CEO John M. Larson.</p>

                    DEFICITS?</font></strong> If nothing else, the for-profits 
                    have shown that there's money to be made in higher ed. For-profit 
                    entrepreneurs have struggled in the kindergarten-to-high school 
                    arena, as exemplified by the ongoing fiscal woes of Edison 
                    Schools Inc. (EDSN ) But Phoenix and others are running financial 
                    circles around conventional colleges even though they survive 
                    on tuition alone, with no endowments or taxpayer subsidies. 
                    In fact, they were one of the stock market's best-performing 
                    sectors during the bear market. Five of them -- Apollo, Corinthian 
                    Colleges (COCO ), Career Education, Strayer Education (STRA 
                    ), and ITT Educational Services (ESI ) -- ranked among the 
                    top 25 of BusinessWeek's Hot Growth Companies this year.</p>
                  <p> For-profit colleges have been a part of U.S. higher education 
                    almost as  
                    long as Harvard College, the nation's oldest. But as recently 
                    as 1990,  
                    virtually all of what are still called &quot;career colleges&quot; 
                    were little  
                    more than trade schools for auto mechanics and secretaries. 
                    Since then,  
                    a government crackdown on shoddy operators, combined with 
                    the economy's  
                    insatiable demand for college grads, has sparked a change 
                    in the  
                    industry. Of today's 4,500-odd remaining for-profits, about 
                    800 now  
                    grant degrees (almost all are accredited), up from just 316 
                    in 1990,  
                    says John Lee, a Bethesda (Md.) educational consultant.</p>
                  <p> Essentially, the new for-profits have taken the ethos of 
                    the traditional  
                    trade school -- delivering specific, marketable skills -- 
                    and applied it  
                    to higher education. For example, Katharine Gibbs, the century-old 
                     
                    secretarial school, has exploded from 2,000 students to 15,000 
                    since it  
                    was bought by Career Education in 1997. Gibbs now offers degrees 
                    in  
                    business and technology to a student population that's 40% 
                    male, vs. 2%  
                    before.</p>
                  <p> Gibbs and others have succeeded by focusing on programs 
                    aimed at  
                    furthering students' careers. Indianapolis-based ITT Educational 
                     
                    Services Inc., which teaches technology subjects such as electronics 
                    to  
                    37,000 students at 76 sites, created its curriculum after 
                    surveying  
                    employers to find out what they need, says CEO Rene Champagne. 
                    The  
                    payoff: ITT placed 73% of its graduates last year amid a jobs 
                    drought  
                    that savaged the prospects of many grads of conventional colleges. 
                    &quot;We  
                    benchmark ourselves against the best customer-service organizations 
                    in  
                    the world,&quot; says Brian Mueller, CEO at the University 
                    of Phoenix Online,  
                    a separate entity from the main university whose 79,000 students 
                    take  
                    all of their courses on the Internet.</p>

                    Addressing student needs is such a core value that it frames 
                    virtually everything for-profits do. Because they have stripped 
                    out so many other costs, they can afford to lavish funds on 
                    direct educational expenses, such as small classes. While 
                    even Harvard University packs hundreds of students into lecture 
                    halls for some introductory courses, University of Phoenix 
                    Online classes average just 11 students per instructor. At 
                    Gibbs College in Boston, classes average 18 to 20 students, 
                    leaving plenty of time for math instructor Sheldon McDonald 
                    to give extra tutoring every week to a student who was struggling 
                    last semester. &quot;When we started, he could barely multiply, 
                    but he did well on the final,&quot; says McDonald.</p>
                  <p> Another challenge: ensuring quality across far-flung networks 
                    of  
                    campuses. For-profits have radically redefined the role of 
                    professors,  
                    for starters. Instead of the centuries-old model of teachers 
                    designing  
                    their own courses, companies such as Phoenix and ITT use academic 
                     
                    professionals to develop much of the curriculum at headquarters. 
                    The  
                    savings are significant, says Career Education Chief Financial 
                    Officer  
                    Patrick K. Pesch, as are the cost advantages of using part-time 
                    faculty  
                    to teach almost all courses.</p>
                  <p> To critics -- and there are many, particularly in academia 
                    -- the real  
                    question is whether the for-profit approach can deliver a 
                    quality  
                    education. In the five years since Kaplan Inc., now owned 
                    by Washington  
                    Post Co. (WPO ), launched the all-online Concord Law School, 
                    enrollment  
                    has ballooned to 1,500 students, making Concord the nation's 
                     
                    second-largest part-time law school. But it has yet to win 
                    the blessing  
                    of the American Bar Assn., which thinks Concord doesn't offer 
                    &quot;a sound  
                    program of legal education,&quot; says Barry Currier, the 
                    ABA's deputy  
                    consultant on legal education.</p>
                  <p> Similarly, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools 
                    of Business, an  
                    oversight body, has refused to accredit the business schools 
                    of the  
                    University of Phoenix and other for-profits. These schools 
                    rely on  
                    &quot;moonlighting amateurs&quot; to teach courses, charges 
                    AACSB CEO John  
                    Fernandes. &quot;It's like running a hospital with orderlies.&quot; 
                    Phoenix is  
                    accredited by the North Central Assn., a major accreditation 
                    group.</p>
                  <p> Many students write off the criticism as snobbery. Some 
                    say they even  
                    prefer classes taught by seasoned professionals such as Phoenix's 
                     
                    Francisco, who can share the marketing lessons he learned 
                    at Kraft.  
                    For-profits &quot;offer a solid education that gives regional 
                    state  
                    universities a real run for their money,&quot; says David 
                    Kirp, a public  
                    policy professor at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
                  <p> This isn't the first time a new breed of institution has 
                    challenged  
                    higher education. In the mid-19th century, Congress created 
                    low-tuition  
                    land-grant universities, schools such as Iowa State University 
                    and Ohio  
                    State University, to expand access to college while teaching 
                    practical  
                    subjects such as agriculture and engineering. In the 1950s 
                    and '60s,  
                    community colleges boomed in response to rising demand. Now, 
                    for-profits  
                    are opening doors to higher education even further. As they 
                    continue to  
                    grow, they may well force some of the weaker traditional colleges 
                    to  
                    improve or implode. Either way, higher education should benefit.
