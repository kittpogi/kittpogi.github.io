                  <p>&#8220;The greatest thing in this world is not so much where 
                    we are, but in what direction we are moving. Unless you set 
                    big, worthwhile goals, you&#8217;ll never move beyond your 
                    current abilities.&#8221; - Oliver Wendell Holmes
                  <p>This best describes the idea that motivates the IT Center 
                    to come up with the Action Plan year after year.</p>
                  <p>So ITC is reminded of the goal of the bigger communities 
                    to which it belongs, the redefined Mission-Vision of DLSU-Manila 
                    and the existing Mission-Vision of the DLS System and the 
                    Professional Schools, Inc. are reflected in this year&#8217;s 
                    edition.</p>
                  <p>Each department has gone over their individual action plans 
                    for 2002-2003 and measured their performance against the specifics 
                    they defined and pushed themselves to achieve more goals and 
                    function better. There have been no changes in the major sections 
                    covered in the Action Plan since the last school year. These 
                    sections still remain as the individual department&#8217;s 
                    mission, vision, quality policy, status report of regular 
                    activities for the previous school year, macro-environmental 
                    changes, TOWS analysis, tedious tasks, recurring problems, 
                    TOWS summary, action plan summary, performance objective, 
                    regular activities and the action plan for the school year 
                    2003-2004.</p>
                  <p>The Computer Facilities and Operations (CFO) Office status 
                    report on the regular activities for the school year 2002-2003 
                    shows more than 100% growth in the number of activities they 
                    have accomplished in comparison to the previous school year. 
                    The report also reflects that the top factor in the economic 
                    macro-environmental changes that happened is the increased 
                    need for on-demand information. It was beefed up with the 
                    addition of increased awareness of out-sourcing.</p>
                  <p>In school year 2001-2002, the TOWS analysis showed that the 
                    top threat was potential security breach posed by the users. 
                    This just goes to show how the users have changed in the span 
                    of one (1) year. The tedious tasks mentioned in the CFO action 
                    plan are as numerous as last year&#8217;s but this year, these 
                    tasks were paralleled with strengths/weaknesses. <br>
                    The action plan summary defines the individual objectives 
                    of the Help Desk group, the systems administration group and 
                    the department head. CFO opted to present it this way to improve 
                    clarity as to what is expected from each group. Their tabulated 
                    Action Plan for SY 2003-2004 is also more specific with the 
                    addition of the groupings of the topics into security, management, 
                    server room, software, document, and hardware for the Systems 
                    Administration Group, and CFO&#8217;s own set of plans for 
                    the PC network group.</p>
                  <p>For the Computer Laboratory Operations (CLO) Group, it is 
                    interesting to note that the additional threat to last year&#8217;s 
                    list is the misdemeanor of lab assistants due to lack of defined 
                    policies. It was noted that the presence of the Discipline 
                    Office hampers these activities and the conduct of investigation 
                    before deciding on issues presented also helped resolve this 
                    problem/threat (?).</p>
                  <p>For the Data Administration Office (DAO), this year&#8217;s 
                    TOWS analysis shows that DAO has eliminated the lack of available 
                    training on data warehousing, data analysis and ad hoc report 
                    generation. Added to the list of last school year&#8217;s 
                    tedious tasks is the need to follow up customers to verify 
                    data accuracy several times to strictly implement data controls 
                    for consistency. Considering the volume of update requests 
                    the DAO staff monitors, this task presents difficulties for 
                    the DAO to beat deadlines that involve report generation.</p>
                  <p>The number of recurring problems has been reduced to two 
                    (2) from the eight (8) posted last school year. These are 
                    the lack of customer&#8217;s adherence to standards and lack 
                    of available materials to prepare standards. The maintenance 
                    of databases including data, stored procedures and access 
                    rights was added to the regular activities. DAO have also 
                    identified the projected intervening projects.</p>
                  <p>The Documentation Office (Docu) has also defined the office&#8217;s 
                    projected intervening projects. They no longer see customer 
                    manual documentation as a tedious task. Recurring problems 
                    have been traced to lack of measurement to determine effectiveness 
                    of web design before launching, lack of customer documentations, 
                    and inability to predict the best timing for customer manual 
                    documentation.</p>
                  <p>Weaknesses have been reduced to more than half its previous 
                    number, from 25 to 10. Eliminated were lack of software to 
                    facilitate on-line web site creation/uploading for customers, 
                    lack of feedback on effectiveness of documentations, lack 
                    of policies on web hosting and access, and lack of skill to 
                    use/maximize software utilization. Docu also defined its intervening 
                    projects.</p>
                  <p>In its TOWS analysis, PRIO added the transition of process 
                    owners to last year&#8217;s threats, which was continuously 
                    reduced through skill in project management and flexibility. 
                    Tedious task is down to one (1) from last year&#8217;s three 
                    (3). Eliminated were transcribing interviews and minutes of 
                    meetings, gathering of materials and other information to 
                    be used for training modules and projects.</p>
                  <p>Items in the summary of action plans is grouped into strategy, 
                    structure, systems, style, skills, staff and shared values. 
                    An almost whole new set of performance objectives was documented 
                    with the performance of system study being given topmost priority. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Their current action plan is also presented in a more detailed 
                    manner with the conduct of system investigation integrated 
                    in the management of research for internal and external faculty 
                    members, undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
                  <p>The System Management Office&#8217;s (SMO) vision has been 
                    enhanced with the integration of University information added. 
                    The status report was also divided into the projects tackled 
                    by the operational section and the developmental section. 
                    These projects were further classified into academic, non-academic, 
                    employee systems, financial systems, integrating systems, 
                    support systems, ITC systems and external systems. The summary 
                    of action plan is grouped into manpower structure, skills, 
                    topics, systems, staff, style, and shared values.</p>
                  <p>The past year&#8217;s staff development summary and the projected 
                    targets are also tabulated at the latter part of the document, 
                    for the whole IT Center and per department.</p>
