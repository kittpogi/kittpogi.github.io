                    reminded of it? Do you practice it? </strong></font>
                  <p>As a member of the Catholic community, we were taught and 
                    we should always be reminded about tithing. Even back in high 
                    school, we were already taught about it. But the only time 
                    that it started to sink in to me was when I became a member 
                    of the Singles For Christ Community. There were a lot of teachings 
                    about it more so on how to manage our finances. We are encouraged 
                    to practice it in order to help others and fund the projects 
                    of our community. </p>
                  <p>The following is a simple yet an enlightening article I got 
                    from the web. Reading it reminded me once more that I am nothing 
                    without Him.</p>

                  <p><strong>Tithes and Offerings</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>(A Crash Course)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>1) Is there a difference between `giving' and `tithing'?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yes. Giving, as we will see in our study, is giving to God 
                    &#8220;as He has prospered us,&#8221; as many coin the phrase. 
                    Tithing, as we hope to show, is giving God &#8220;what is 
                    due Him.&#8221; If something is &#8220;due&#8221; or &#8220;owed,&#8221; 
                    it isn't giving. When you send you're payment for the electric 
                    bill this month, are you `giving&#8221; them your money, or 
                    &#8220;paying what is due?&#8221; You are &#8220;paying what 
                    is due.&#8221;</p>
                  <p><strong>2) Define `tithing'.</strong></p>
                  <p>Tithing is, in simple terms &#8220;paying 10% to God.&#8221; 
                    But for those who would prefer a Hebrew (Old Testament) definition, 
                    tithe is defined as follows:</p>
                  <p>1. dekatoo NT:1183, from dekatos, &quot;tenth&quot;, in the 
                    active voice denotes &quot;to take tithes of,&quot; Heb 7:6, 
                    RV, &quot;hath taken (KJV, received) tithes&quot;; in the 
                    passive, &quot;to pay tithes,&quot; 7:9, RV, &quot;hath paid 
                    (KJV, 'payed') tithes.&quot; In the Sept., Neh 10:37.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. apodekatoo NT:586 denotes (a) &quot;to tithe&quot; (apo, 
                    &quot;from,&quot; dekatos, &quot;tenth&quot;), Matt 23:23 
                    (KJV, &quot;pay tithe of&quot;); Luke 11:42&gt;; in Luke 18:12 
                    (where the best texts have the alternative form apodekateuo), 
                    &quot;I give tithes&quot;; (b) &quot;to exact tithes&quot; 
                    from Heb 7:5. <br>
                    <br>
                    3. apodekateuo NT:586 v, &quot;to give tithes,&quot; in Luke 
                    18:12 (some texts have No. 2). Vine's Expository Dictionary 
                    of Biblical Words, Copyright (c)1985, Thomas Nelson Publishers)</p>
                  <p><strong>3) Why do we need to give our `money' to God? Does 
                    He need it?</strong></p>
                  <p>He doesn't need it. He doesn't need us! But He can use us, 
                    and He can use what we give Him to further His Kingdom (i.e. 
                    &#8220;Bless the gift and the giver&#8221;). So why do we 
                    give? Yes, it should be for the purpose of &#8220;furthering 
                    the growth of the Kingdom&#8221; (the church,) but we give 
                    primarily to further our personal spiritual growth. <br>
                    In this world of self-proclaimed independence, the church 
                    must be constantly aware of our need for dependence, dependence 
                    upon God and dependence upon one another. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Giving/Tithing:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Reminds us that what we possess really isn't ours<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reminds us that the Lord is God<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reminds us that God has given to us<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Causes us to reflect upon God, the church, and our priorities<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Helps to subdue the temptation to be selfish and covetous<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Allows us to show our faith and love for the church and 
                      the Lord Jesus is good practice<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Takes our eyes off of self</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Denver Sizemore gives these basic &#8220;Reasons For Giving.&#8221;</p>
                  <p><strong>A) Advance The Work of the Kingdom</strong></p>
                  <p>Philippians 4:15-16, &#8220;And you yourselves also know, 
                    Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after 
                    I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the 
                    matter of giving and receiving but you alone; 16 for even 
                    in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs&#8221; 
                    (NAS).</p>
                  <p>2 Corinthians 11:9, &#8220;and when I was present with you 
                    and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for when the 
                    brethren came from Macedonia, they fully supplied my need, 
                    and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, 
                    and will continue to do so&#8221; (NAS).<br>
                    When we write our check(s), do we reflect upon the growth 
                    and work of the Kingdom?</p>
                  <p><strong>B) To Develop Spirituality In The Christian</strong></p>
                  <p>2 Corinthians 9:11, &#8220;you will be enriched in everything 
                    for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving 
                    to God&#8221; (NAS).</p>
                  <p>2 Corinthians 9:7, &#8220;Let each one do just as he has 
                    purposed in his heart; not grudgingly or under compulsion; 
                    for God loves a cheerful giver&#8221; (NAS).</p>
                  <p>Luke 16:10-12, &#8220;He who is faithful in a very little 
                    thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous 
                    in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much. 11 &quot;If 
                    therefore you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous 
                    mammon, who will entrust the true riches to you? 12 &quot;And 
                    if you have not been faithful in the use of that which is 
                    another's, who will give you that which is your own?&#8221; 
                    (NAS).</p>
                  <p>We develop a Christ-like attitude in giving. Remember Matthew 
                    6:21, &#8220;For where your treasure is, there will your heart 
                    be also&#8221; (NAS)? If we are not faithful in the stewardship 
                    of the material wealth that we have received how can we expect 
                    the TRUE riches of God to become ours? We develop a &#8220;right&#8221; 
                    attitude toward money. Recall the rich young ruler (Mark 10)?

                  <p>Prayer Of Generosity <br>
                    Saint Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) <br>
                    Dearest Lord, teach me to be generous. <br>
                    Teach me to serve You as You deserve; <br>
                    to give and not to count the cost; <br>
                    to fight and not to heed the wounds; <br>
                    to toil and not to seek for rest; <br>
                    to labor and not to ask for reward, save that of <br>
                    knowing that I am doing Your will. Amen</p>
                  <p></p>
