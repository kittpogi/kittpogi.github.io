                    Web Site Survey</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    It is very heart-warming to note that still a good number 
                    of our DLSU-Manila web site surfers care enough to take the 
                    time to tell us what they think and suggest ways to make it 
                    more useful. It came with praises. It came with criticisms.<br>
                    <br>
                    Of the 20 or so correspondents, most belong to the 16-25 age 
                    range. One indicated that she is over 50 years old and commended 
                    our graphics, layout and style. We have collated the ones 
                    that we have received so far, just to present to you how we 
                    are doing so far. 
                  <p><strong>ARE THE INFORMATION ACCURATE AND CLEAR?</strong><br>
                    How we wish for the people who appreciate the web site to 
                    have elaborated a little bit. However, they answered with 
                    a simple YES. On the other hand, those who found a hard time 
                    navigating around were more specific:<br>
                    <br>
                    - Not up-to-date<br>
                    - does not contain what we're looking for.<br>
                    - I wouldn't know. Even the print materials are saying different 
                    things from one another.<br>
                    - The information is clear however there are some pages that 
                    are not updated regularly.</p>
                  <p><strong>Is it easy to look for information on the Web Site?</strong><br>
                    Our surfers were divided almost into half. There were some 
                    who answered with a simple YES and some with a plain NO.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>PRAISES:</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    - Very comprehensive and very user-friendly<br>
                    - Yes it is easy to look for information and there have been 
                    some people who tell me that the dlsu<br>
                    website is nice because almost all the (important) information 
                    are here.<br>
                    <strong><br>
                    CRITICISMS:</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    - Yes. But the appearance of the website looks so busy. Each 
                    part fights for my attention. No hierarchy.</p>
                  <p><strong>Are the information relevant and timely?</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Again, most respondents answered with a simple YES. Some who 
                    didn&#8217;t agree answered:<br>
                    <br>
                    - I wouldn't know. Even the print materials are saying different 
                    things from one another.<br>
                    - You should present more news which involves the university. 
                    Also, show achievements in which the university has bannered.</p>
                  <p><strong>What do you think about the overall aesthetics of 
                    the site?</strong><br>
                    The respondents were divided between liking it and suggesting 
                    more ways on how to improve it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>PRAISES:</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    - Great!<br>
                    - Nice!<br>
                    - They&#8217;re pretty cool!<br>
                    - Graphics, layout, style very attractive!<br>
                    - Graphics are great and fascinating, a job well done!<br>
                    - I like the layout.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>CRITICISMS:</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    - Too much flash animations<br>
                    - The site is very dark. It must be pleasant to the eye. I 
                    just can&#8217;t see the reason why you have to choose the 
                    color gray as background. our school color is green and white, 
                    not gray. Bring back the old &quot;corinthian columns&quot; 
                    look.<br>
                    -Its kind of boring because the background colors were dark..<br>
                    - This was what I was going to focus on. The overall look 
                    has a new look but there's some inconsistency. The header 
                    has a joyous look, yet some of the contents look quite dull 
                    in color. If you want to keep the color scheme to a green 
                    hue, it would be best to use a lighter shade to keep the atmosphere 
                    light.<br>
                    -I think that the font size needs to be a bit bigger because 
                    it's difficult to read esp. for people who have eye problems 
                    like me.<br>
                    - The site focuses too much on aesthetics and lacking on ease 
                    of use. I don't want to have to wait for some flash effects 
                    to do it's thing before I get to information I need.<br>
                    - Good but the flash takes a long time to load, which might 
                    discourage people on dial-up<br>
                    to stop visiting the site.</p>

                    video... thank you..<br>
                    - It would be better if you would place pictures of players..fun 
                    isn't it<br>
                    - the layout, is more up-to-date with the standards, and provides 
                    a clearer and browse-easy look for the users to use. Nice 
                    work. ;)<br>
                    - Animo La Salle!<br>
                    - Keep up the good work. really nice and user-friendly site. 
                    i did not get lost like in other university-web sites.<br>
                    - Kudos to the front-end and especially the back end team

                    <br>
                    - Do a part presenting the university's state-of -the-art 
                    facilties. We always brag about our facilities, but how would 
                    the outsiders really know how good they are without seeing 
                    it, even just in photos.<br>
                    - Please use high quality photos and nice color combinations.<br>
                    - More pictures of dlsu-manila.<br>
                    - No cartoon picture of an archer<br>
                    - Please use high quality photos and nice color combinations.</p>
                  <p>We know that these comments gave us something to think about. 
                    It is now up to us to separate the &#8220;note-worthy&#8221; 
                    from the &#8220;noise comments&#8221;. <br>

                    By: Rey Mendoza<br>
                    <br>
                    </strong>The Help Desk web site (<a href="http://helpdesk.dlsu.edu.ph/">http://helpdesk.dlsu.edu.ph/</a>) 
                    is undergoing a major facelift and reorganization this term. 
                    Keeping up with the &#8220;new trend&#8221; in the web design 
                    community, I am designing the Help Desk website in a new way. 
                    The CSS web design way.<br>
                    <br>
                    CSS stands for cascading style sheet. CSS allows the web designer 
                    to create a design which is separate from the content and 
                    change the look of the whole web site by modifying the CSS 
                    only! With CSS, the web designer can layout a web site without 
                    using tables.<br>
                    <br>
                    The disadvantage of using tables in web design is that it 
                    takes time to load in a page. Web browsers make sure that 
                    each table downloads as a single entity. As a result, none 
                    of the materials put in a table will be displayed until all 
                    of its contents are downloaded to the client machine for display. 
                  <p>The use of CSS also speeds up site maintenance by separating 
                    the content from the layout, writes device-independent pages 
                    that are viewable across all browsers, creates web pages recognizable 
                    by search-engine spiders, composes accessible codes that has 
                    become legal requirements in a number of countries, allows 
                    the users of the web site to chooses among designs a programmer 
                    has created and provides a print-friendly version of the web 
                    site.<br>

                  <p><strong><a name="isguide"></a>DLSU International Student 
                    Guide Website</strong><br>
                    By: Rey Mendoza,Jr. 
                  <p>The DLSU International Student Website Guide is a reference 
                    for aspiring foreign students who wish to study at De La Salle 
                    University-Manila.</p>
                  <p>The web design of the Int&#8217;l Student Guide is, for the 
                    most part, a replicate of its printed version. The cover design 
                    of the printed edition served as the background image of the 
                    web site. The Marketing Communication Office (MCO) provided 
                    the e-files of the graphics posted in it. In the Philippine 
                    link, the corresponding PINAS web site link is found in each 
                    section.</p>
                  <p>The navigation design of the web site has been kept simple. 
                    Most information can be accessed in one click or less. The 
                    Fluid Dynamics search feature is also displayed in most pages.</p>
                  <p>The DLSU Int&#8217;l Student Guide can be found at <a href="http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/students/international/index.asp">http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/students/international/index.asp</a><br>
                  </p>
                  <p><strong><a name="vpar"></a>VPAR Forms</strong> 
                  <p>The Office of the Vice-President for Academics and Research 
                    (VPAR) should be commended on maximizing the use of the Intranet&#8217;s 
                    download section. In the Intranet, the number of downloadable 
                    VPAR forms is as much as the number of downloadable ITC forms. 
                    Now, people need not keep in their files multiple copies of 
                    leave forms, Application for Study Grant, Internet Dial-up 
                    Memorandum of Agreement, and the likes. Also, since these 
                    are fillable forms, they only need their pens for signing.<br>
