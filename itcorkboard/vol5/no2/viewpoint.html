                    security nowadays has to be tightened&#8230; by each one of 
                    us if we want to live longer&#8230;
                  <p>More than a week ago, a mishap occurred to one of our colleagues 
                    here in ITC. On a Friday afternoon around 4pm, our officemate 
                    Amy and her son, Lambert, were held-up by a couple while walking 
                    along the sidewalks of Taft Avenue. Amy and her son were on 
                    their way to the North Gate of DLSU for their usual merienda 
                    when one of the alleged malefactors, a female pedestrian, 
                    pointed a pen, which apparently was a cutter blade, on Amy&#8217;s 
                    side. The male companion of the female felon obviously, took 
                    charge of Lambert. Amy, notwithstanding the fear and threat 
                    of the situation especially that it involved the life of her 
                    son, screamed for help and shouted at his son to run. But 
                    unfortunately, even though a crowd has already started to 
                    build up in the area, Amy still suffered stabs on her arm, 
                    near the wrist area, while her son too suffered stabs in his 
                    arm and bruises at his back. Apparently, Lambert was able 
                    to escape and called one of the security guards in the DLSU 
                    North gate but to Amy&#8217;s dismay, while blood profusely 
                    flowed from her arm, the Security Guard disregarded the incident 
                    and went back to his post. The reason being that, he could 
                    not recognize the wrong doer from the victim. Even when Amy 
                    and Lambert reached North Gate and asked for help, it still 
                    took a yelling command from a concerned male faculty that 
                    the security guards started to assist quickly and go after 
                    the criminals. Thank God, the offenders were caught and brought 
                    to the police while our officemate and her son were immediately 
                    brought to Ospital ng Maynila for proper treatment and medico 
                    legal procedures. </p>
                  <p>On hearing this story, I felt sorry for Amy and her son. 
                    I definitely felt very bad about the initial, insensitive 
                    actions of the security guard. Whatever happened to his sworn 
                    duty to help and protect our students and personnel from the 
                    evil elements of our society? Whatever happened to our human 
                    instinct to help each other at the sight of the crime but 
                    do not instead simply because we are afraid the offenders 
                    might go after us? I often hear this from friends and even 
                    from my parents, to take extra care before helping out when 
                    it comes to actual crime scenes so as not to unnecessarily 
                    be involved with it. I understand the basis but what about 
                    the cause for unity we always try to speak about to help fight 
                    violence in this country? Are we just going to remain bystanders 
                    letting the crime go on unsolved or apathetically watch the 
                    victims endure the violence?&#8230;. Perhaps that is one of 
                    the reasons why justice is unreachable in this country. Simply 
                    because, we are not brave enough to take a selfless stand, 
                    to unite and fight the evil in our society. Are we just hoping 
                    against hope that someday, someone will initiate to make a 
                    stand and come to our aid during the perilous seconds of our 
                    life? Will it always be the clich&eacute; &#8220;my safety 
                    first before others&#8221;? Then I guess there&#8217;s no 
                    reason for us to be where we are right now as being educated 
                    and intuitive human beings. No man is an island? Or so I thought.</p>
                  <p>I just hope and pray, we would soon realize that all of these 
                    crimes are just but a part of a vicious cycle that one day 
                    could happen to each one of us if we will not do anything 
                    about it. Yes, it could happen to you, to me and to our children.
