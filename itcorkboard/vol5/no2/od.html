                    defines innovation as &#8220;The introduction ofsomething 
                    new &#8211; a new idea, method, or device. Any artifice that 
                    generates a new pattern of use, behavior, or thinking that 
                    is different from previous patterns in the same field.&#8221; 
                  <p>In the recent Innovation Awards organized by MIS Asia, DLSU 
                    was a finalist (though not an awardee) from 75 nominees. We 
                    earned our place in the Infrastructure category. The decision 
                    was based on our Internet infrastructure particularly the 
                    satellite dish set-up where we saved a total of P5 million 
                    from February 2000 to May 2003. Even though we did not make 
                    it, this should not stop us in introducing IT innovations 
                    to the University. This should even inspire us to strive harder 
                    and give greater positivue impact to the University.</p>

                  <p>In the nomination period, it was clear that the criteria 
                    for best innovation are based on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) 
                    where four dimensions are to be measured and assessed to see 
                    how far each contributes to the organization&#8217;s mission, 
                    vision, and objectives. These dimensions are financial performance, 
                    customer satisfaction, efficient business processes (or internal 
                    operations), and innovation, learning and growth.</p>
                  <p>For more information about the balanced scorecard, you can 
                    visit <a href="www.balancedscorecard.com">www.balancedscorecard.com</a> 
                    and <a href="www.bscol.com">www.bscol.com</a>. In the first 
                    site, you can see this statement: &#8220;The Balanced Scorecard 
                    translates a company&#8217;s vision and strategy into tangible 
                    objectives and measures.&#8221; According to the Balanced 
                    Scorecard Collaborative, BSC is &#8220;a tool that translates 
                    an organization's mission and strategy into a comprehensive 
                    set of performance measures that provides the framework for 
                    a strategic measurement and management system.&#8221;</p>

                  <p>One interesting and valid question that I got a few times 
                    is: &#8220;How can we contribute to revenues and savings?&#8221; 
                    Here are some examples that focus on cost whenever infrastructure 
                    is &#8220;down&#8221;. The figures may not be accurate and 
                    the formulas are not based on any scientific research.</p>
                  <p> A department has 10 faculty members. They have an average 
                    hourly rate of P200. If that department has five computers, 
                    only five faculty members could use the computer at a time. 
                    If all of them need to use the computers, five could not be 
                    productive. That results to an hourly cost of P200 x 5 = P1,000. 
                    If one of the five computers is out of order, that results 
                    to an hourly cost of P200 x 6 = P1,200. If we are only to 
                    compute the productivity cost of one faculty member on one 
                    computer, the cost would be P200 x 8 = P1,600 per eight -hour 
                    day if the computer is not fixed within one day.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p> Let&#8217;s assume that the University has an average hourly 
                    rate of P150 per faculty member. If there are 10 computers 
                    which are out of order and are fixed only after one day, the 
                    productivity cost for an eight-hour day would be P150 x 10 
                    x 8 = P12,000. For a week, this translates to P12,000 x 7 
                    = P84,000.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    If our e-mail server is not available, &#8220;everyone&#8221; 
                    won&#8217;t be able to communicate via e-mail. Assume 50 people 
                    (with an average hourly rate of P200) need to urgently communicate 
                    within the hour, this can computed as P200 x 50 = P10,000 
                    per hour.</p>
                  <p>The above examples give straightforward cost computations. 
                    Let&#8217;s consider the other side of the coin but more difficult 
                    to quantify. Let&#8217;s assume we are able to make on-line 
                    enrollment available &#8211; i.e., zero problem. This includes 
                    the Internet infrastructure plus our program, servers, and 
                    network. What should we consider?</p>
                  <p> People from the Registrar&#8217;s Office need not bother 
                    about the manual enrollment process. Assume eight-hour enrollment 
                    period per day for four days and hourly rate of P85 for six 
                    people. This will be P85 x 6 x 8 x 4 = P16,320. For three 
                    trimesters, that will be about P48,960. Let&#8217;s just round 
                    this off to P49,000 per year.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    Assuming automated course approval but this is fully implemented 
                    already, we can include savings from Academic Assistants, 
                    who do academic advising for students. For simplicity, let&#8217;s 
                    also assume that the savings would be equal to that on Registrar&#8217;s 
                    Office personnel. That&#8217;ll be around P49,000 per year.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    People from ITC need not set-up computers and network cables 
                    at the Conservatory. Install and uninstall time would be about 
                    five hours (example only) for four people. Assume hourly rate 
                    is P100. The savings would be P100 x 2 x 5 = P1,000 per enrollment 
                    period. For three trimesters, that will be about P3,000 per 
                    school year.</p>
                  <p>So far we have P49,000 + P49,000 + P3,000 = P101,000 per 
                    year. But I think the actual figure is higher. The counterpart 
                    of this savings is the cost of developing and maintaining 
                    the programs and licenses. The license for the database would 
                    be the same. IT infrastructure could remain the same &#8211; 
                    i.e., using the same servers, network, and PCs&#8230;actually, 
                    lesser DLSU PCs. Here are some more items to consider.</p>
                  <p> Students are able to enroll in less than 10 minutes, assuming 
                    their accounts are okay. No queuing, except for payment (for 
                    now). Let&#8217;s assume that they&#8217;re happy and satisfied. 
                    What figure do we put on customer satisfaction?</p>
                  <p><br>
                    On-line enrollment adds to the prestige and reputation of 
                    DLSU. What figure do we put on this?</p>
                  <p>Another way to contribute to savings and revenue is simply 
                    by doing what we&#8217;re expected to do. I got feedback that 
                    one applicant chose the blue school because he/she thought 
                    does not have wireless network infrastructure. Assuming this 
                    really happened, we needed to promote our wireless services 
                    some more. I&#8217;ve informed MCO about this. Let&#8217;s 
                    hope that all IT initiatives and facilities would be made 
                    known in the usual marketing channels (e.g., student catalog, 
                    DLSU/Library/Admissions/DLSAA web sites, conference web sites 
                    that we host, student publications, local dailies, vendor 
                    publications, foreign magazines, professional organizations, 
                    and virtual communities). By helping improve the prestige 
                    and reputation of DLSU, we also help attract applicants, scholars, 
                    researchers, employees, and donors for DLSU. And for those 
                    who are already here, we also help improve their/our sense 
                    of pride and fulfillment in being part of the DLSU community.</p>
                  <p>Another unchartered territory is vendor resources. One day, 
                    HP Philippines asked me what else it can do for DLSU to improve 
                    its services and the &#8220;partnership&#8221;. I gave my 
                    inputs and also asked if HP is interested in financing a scholarship 
                    program. It first started at P150,000 per school year. But 
                    when HP asked for more details (e.g., background of scholarship 
                    and the degree program concerned), I passed the ball to CCS 
                    since CCS is in a better position to deal with this. The scholarship 
                    requirement became around P1 million. I think this is the 
                    scholarship program requirement of DLSU to make it viable 
                    and sustainable. Whether or not this HP scholarship program 
                    pushes through, we/ITC did something to contribute to revenues 
                    and savings. I wonder when Microsoft will ask us about their 
                    services. It might be a good time to e-mail them. </p>
