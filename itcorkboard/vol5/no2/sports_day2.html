                    <strong>Day 2, Aug 22, 4:15 am</strong></p>
                  <p>After more than six hours of traveling, we finally arrived 
                    at Baguio City. Two more people were joining the group and 
                    we all agreed to meet at Chowking in Session Road. Harold 
                    also asked the jeeps which were taking us to Ambangeg to meet 
                    us there.</p>
                  <p>At Chowking, only one cash register was working. This meant 
                    that there was a very long line of hungry people. Fortunately, 
                    the Chowking staff was quite efficient and was able to prevent 
                    tempers from flaring.</p>
                  <p>After breakfast, majority of the group decided to order take-out 
                    for lunch. After packing these lunches inside our bag, we 
                    were raring to go. Because we were such a large group, we 
                    hired two jeeps. Mark, Francis, Jojo, Joel, Ryan and I were 
                    in one jeep while Harold, Lorna, and Precious were in another. 
                    I was feeling pretty excited and steeling my nerves for the 
                    long and tiring journey ahead. In hindsight, I sometimes wonder, 
                    would I have decided to continue with the climb if I had known 
                    then what surprises Mt. Pulag would have in store for us?</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <strong>Day 2, Aug 22, 5:50 am</strong></p>
                  <p>Shortly before six in the morning, we left Chowking for the 
                    DENR station. We were hoping to get there before lunch so 
                    that we can reach the campsite before dark. Our first stop 
                    was beside a hanging bridge. A few people decided to cross 
                    the bridge to see what was on the other side while the others 
                    were content with waiting inside the jeeps. After taking a 
                    few pictures, we were off again. Our next stop was the Ambuklao 
                    dam. It was really &#8220;dam&#8221; big (pun intended). J</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <strong>Day 2, Aug 22, 11:00 am</strong></p>
                  <p>We finally reached the DENR office. Before climbing, it was 
                    government policy that all visitors to the Mt. Pulag National 
                    Park attend an orientation seminar. It was no surprise that 
                    there were three other groups present during the orientation. 
                    After all, with GMA&#8217;s holiday economics, it was another 
                    long weekend. </p>
                  <p>The orientation was conducted by Ms.Emerita Tamiray. To tell 
                    you the truth, I was too tired and sleepy to be able to understand 
                    everything Ms. Tamiray was discussing. She even showed us 
                    an American video showing basic campsite etiquette; however, 
                    I did get the impression that she is a very hard-working lady 
                    and that the DENR is lucky is to have her working with them.</p>
                  <p>Since it was past lunch time, we decided to take our lunch 
                    before continuing with the journey. As fate would have it, 
                    this was when it started to rain. It dawned on me then that 
                    it was going to be a really LONG day.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <strong>Day 2, Aug 22, 1:00 pm</strong></p>
                  <p>After a few more minutes going uphill, it was apparent that 
                    we had to walk the rest of the way up. The trail was simply 
                    too wet and muddy for the jeep to continue. At this point, 
                    you have to understand that our goal like any other mountain 
                    climber was to reach Mt. Pulag&#8217;s summit.</p>
                  <p>The planned itinerary was simple enough:<br>
                    &middot; From Baguio, travel by jeep to the ranger station,<br>
                    &middot; Walk about three hours to get to the camp site,<br>
                    &middot; Spend the night in camp,<br>
                    &middot; From camp and while still dark, hike another one-a-half 
                    hours to get to the summit,<br>
                    &middot; Enjoy the sunrise!</p>
                  <p>It seemed logical and manageable at that time. Of course, 
                    several members of the group (like myself) were first-time 
                    climbers and did not know any better. &#8220;Carpe Diem,&#8221; 
                    we said.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <strong>Day 2, Aug 22, 3:00 pm</strong></p>
                  <p>The first three hours were for me the hardest. It was during 
                    this time when I truly realized just how &#8220;out of shape&#8221; 
                    I was. By 4:30 pm, every step was excruciating, every movement 
                    torturous, and every path, more tortuous. It didn&#8217;t 
                    help that the trail was mostly uphill and that by this time, 
                    rain was starting to pour harder. </p>
                  <p>We kept asking people we meet on the way up how much farther 
                    the ranger station was and they kept giving us the same standard 
                    answer: &#8220;Malayo pa.&#8221; First, a lady told us that 
                    it was still about one hour away. After an hour, we asked 
                    another person and he told us that it was just thirty minutes 
                    away. After another hour, we asked a third lady and she told 
                    us that it was still thirty minutes away. We were getting 
                    frustrated, to say the least.</p>
                  <p>The higher the altitude got, the lower the temperature became. 
                    And I still haven&#8217;t factored in the wind chill factor. 
                    Having a slight breeze or even a moderately strong wind blow 
                    over you on a sunny day can be a pleasant experience but when 
                    you&#8217;re wet, bone tired, and cold, even the slightest 
                    gust of wind becomes rather painful.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <strong>Day 2, Aug 22, 5:00 pm</strong></p>
                  <p>Four hours ago, I couldn&#8217;t wait to start the trek. 
                    Now, I&#8217;m just about ready to start cursing Harold and 
                    all his ancestors. But that wouldn&#8217;t be fair to him. 
                    After all, I wasn&#8217;t dragged kicking and screaming. I 
                    came on my own free will (insane maybe but still free will). 
                    We also had an inkling that the weather wasn&#8217;t ideal 
                    for mountain climbing. After all, two days before we left, 
                    a typhoon devastated Luzon with news that another one was 
                    on its tail.</p>
                  <p>This was when I decided that I had to get to the ranger station 
                    as soon as possible. It was either that or I&#8217;ll just 
                    lie in the middle of the road and wait for certain death.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <strong>Day 2, Aug 22, 6:00 pm</strong></p>
                  <p>At long last, after knocking on several doors asking for 
                    directions, I finally reached the ranger station. I had to 
                    read the sign several times because I couldn&#8217;t believe 
                    that I finally made it. And guess what, there wasn&#8217;t 
                    a ranger in sight. I had to double back a few meters and ask 
                    the neighboring houses if I was in the right place just to 
                    be sure.</p>
                  <p>Luckily, when I got back to the ranger station, Samuel, a 
                    ranger was inside the station. After several minutes, I saw 
                    Joel hurrying towards the shelter.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <strong>Day 2, Aug 22, 7:00 pm</strong></p>
                  <p>By this time, Lorna, Pres, Ryan, Mark, Francis, Johnny, Jojo, 
                    Kat (Mark&#8217;s girlfriend), Joy &amp; Jeff (Pres&#8217; 
                    friends), and Joel (Mark&#8217;s friend) found their way to 
                    the ranger station. We immediately began plans to cook dinner 
                    and discuss the sleeping arrangements.</p>
                  <p>While Jeff, Lorna, Pres, Johnny, Joel K., and I were busy 
                    with preparing the nilagang baka, pork teriyaki, and rice, 
                    the others were changing into dry clothes.</p>
                  <p>Let me tell you this, the meal was superb. We feasted like 
                    we hadn&#8217;t eaten for days. After dinner, everyone was 
                    eager to talk about the shared experience. One person mentioned 
                    that he didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d survive. Another said 
                    that it was one of the most thrilling experiences of her life. 
                    As for me, I honestly can say that I haven&#8217;t felt cold 
                    like I did at that time.</p>
