                  <p> We know what you&#8217;re thinking. It has been a long time 
                    since we started working on the revised <a href="http://system.dlsu.edu.ph" target="_blank"><b>DLS System</b></a> web site. It should have been replaced a long 
                    time ago. <img src="../../vol5/no1/images/system.jpg" alt="dlsu system web site" width="250" height="259" align="right">The 
                    newest System members are not yet included in it. Its presentation 
                    can only be described as outdated&#8230; outmoded &#8230; 
                    pass&eacute;. 
                  <p>The waiting is over. Finally, the enhanced System web site 
                    has already been launched. Among others, it now includes the 
                    DLS-Araneta University campus and the DLS-Canlubang web site.</p>
                  <p>Just like the current Manila website, content and layout 
                    management is less complicated with the use of active server 
                    pages (ASP). In comparison to its old edition, the System 
                    website is easier on the eyes with a more upbeat design, easier 
                    navigation style and more comprehensive. The images included 
                    are also more updated. The online version of the President&#8217;s 
                    Report SY 2001-2002 is accessible here. The web site surely 
                    gave justice to its print edition. (See related article)</p>
                  <p>Content-wise, it is more descriptive. In the Academic link, 
                    each of the campuses is briefly described together with its 
                    mailing address and contact numbers. We know that surfers 
                    out there will find these information invaluable. An overview 
                    of each major link is included with links to details in the 
                    system school to its web site. The consolidated course offerings 
                    grid provides a list of degree offerings per campus.</p>
                  <p>As the number of electronic files continue to grow and the 
                    requests to make them accessible to the public shoots up, 
                    we have compiled these files and encourage others to do so. 
                    It is aptly called the multimedia bank. In the multimedia 
                    bank, a compilation of different e-files has been systematically 
                    categorized into stock photography, artworks, illustrations, 
                    sounds, videos, animations and presentations, in their most 
                    widely-used types of formats. Practically anybody can submit 
                    files according to maximum file size allowed. They will also 
                    be notified upon receipt of the files through e-mail. An administrator 
                    will evaluate the submitted files before posting.</p>
                  <p>That&#8217;s not all, we have also included information regarding:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Services and resources</li>
                    <li> Scholarships/Grants for students and employees</li>

                    magnetic strips and bar codes. This is in line with the standardization 
                    of all campus-wide. campus-wide IDs. </p>
                  <p>The design for each ID is unique. The front bears the logo 
                    of the office and the back displays information such as the 
                    office&#8217;s complete mailing address and contact numbers. 
                    It also bears the signature of the authorized signatory of 
                    the office concerned.</p>
                  <p>The design for the System Personnel IDs has also been completed 
                    and submitted to the President&#8217;s Office for approval.

                  <p>For the research staff ID, a bar-coded ID, the design has 
                    also been completed and implemented.</p>

                  <p>&#8220;These voices are the students, faculty and staff members, 
                    and administrators who have continued to excel in their own

                    academic institutions and industry, both in the country and

                  <p>So goes an excerpt from <b>VOICES</b>, The <a href="http://system.dlsu.edu.ph/administration/president/report/2001-2002/default.asp" target="_blank"></a><b><a href="http://system.dlsu.edu.ph/administration/president/report/2001-2002/default.asp" target="_blank">President&#8217;s 
                    Report 2001-2002</a></b> edition. As System President Bro. 
                    Rolando Dizon is about to answer a higher calling, his office 
                    recapped the events that transpired in all campuses in the 
                    said school year. </p>
                  <p>In VOICES, his office recounted past events, assessed the 
                    present situation and projected the direction of the La Sallian 
                    family, particularly in the next ten (10) years. This was 
                    in time for the accomplishment of the GREENOVATION project 
                    which kicked-off in the said school year. Greenovation is 
                    the ten-year countdown to the centenary of the establishment 
                    of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in the Philippines.</p>
                  <p>In order to reach the most number of people, the on-line 
                    version was launched as part of the redesigned DLS System 
                    web site in the President&#8217;s page under the Administration 
                    link. The VOICES web site thrived in its simplicity as it 
                    highlighted the messages it delivered in each page.</p>
                  <p>The web site did not veer away much from the design of the 
                    printed edition. Printed flip open pages were presented as 
                    popup windows online. The links to major topics are found 
                    at the top and lower left parts of each page. As with the 
                    printed edition, it basically made use of earth-tone colors 
                    such as ash gray and shades of brown.<br>
