                      Carefully, she goes from one point to another looking UP 
                      to see if water falls from just one area, and DOWN so she 
                      will not slip and fall. A quick survey reveals that there 
                      are 2 more computer units that are in danger of getting 
                      wet.</i></p>

                      that unless the computers and their peripherals are moved, 
                      they might cause short circuit. They unhooked all the computers

                  <p>Nope, this is not the opening scene from a mystery/thriller/horror 
                    movie. This was the scenario inside the different offices 
                    of the IT Center and outside Gokongwei Building.</p>
                  <p><b>May 27, Tuesday (1:30 p.m.)</b> - DLSU-Manila announced 
                    the suspension of classes and offices as it deemed necessary. 
                    Students and employees alike filled the hallways, corridors 
                    and entrance/exit points in the different buildings within 
                    the campus deciding on braving the storm and going home or 
                    letting the rains subside a little.</p>
                  <p>Most ITPs opted to stay in their workstations. Most ITPs 
                    were still staring at their respective monitors. A few others 
                    loitered around curiously observing what was keeping the other 
                    guys busy.</p>
                  <p>The SMO/PRIO and DAO/DOCU Rooms were hazard areas, so to 
                    speak. What kept us puzzled was, as there is still a floor 
                    above us, where did all this water come from?</p>
                  <p>People in the rooms good-humoredly informed me that this 
                    was not the first time it happened. They were even surprised 
                    because these were not the ceiling areas that were wet in 
                    the previous years.</p>
                  <p>It was a good thing there was a spare umbrella in the office. 
                    As Sir James&#8217; cabinet is locked, we just placed it on 
                    top so his computer or his things would have gotten wet. It 
                    was also good that there were a number of empty trash cans 
                    to collect he drippings.</p>
                  <p><b>May 28, Wednesday (7:00 a.m.)</b> - A number of ITPs received 
                    text messages from caring officemates who were wise enough 
                    to inquire regarding office suspension for the day before 
                    preparing for the office. And who said texting is all but 
                    a waste of time?</p>
                  <p>Sally had a different story for the day. Who will ever question 
                    her dedication to her work? Since she hails from the City 
                    of Malabon (we all know how high the waters rise in this place 
                    during heavy rains), she got out of bed early enough to be 
                    in the office before 8:00 a.m. (Was it true that Sir Sammy 
                    also dropped by the office in his immaculate polo barong that 
                    same morning?)</p>
                  <p><b>May 29, Wednesday</b> - Waking up to a clear sky brought 
                    about the feeling of being in the Twilight Zone. Many of us 
                    wanted to go back to Dreamland and stay there until noontime 
                    again. A number still tried calling up the trunkline just 
                    to check if classes and offices will really resume on that 
                    day. In vain, of course.</p>
                  <p>Walking to my cubicle in my usual manner I suddenly stepped 
                    on something wet. I looked down my feet and see practically 
                    half of the room flooded with water. I showed it to Sally 
                    and she contacted a janitor at once. Soon, Albert arrived. 
                    He smilingly asked why I was staying in Joie&#8217;s cubicle 
                    and found the answer to the question himself. Yup, yup. He 
                    stepped on the puddle of water too.</p>
                  <p>And then Francis arrives. He found that his workstation is 
                    the hardest hit with his computers neatly placed in the conference 
                    room.</p>
                  <p>During lunch break, as the ceiling was still dripping wet, 
                    a patch of it fell when we were inside the room. It was a 
                    good thing nobody got hurt!</p>
                  <p>In our room alone, one complete computer set - CPU, monitor 
                    and keyboard, and one colored printer were collected by the 
                    CFO for blow-drying.</p>
                  <p>The musty stench of soiled wood and dirty water filled the 
                    room and persisted for two days. Most of us covered our computer 
                    units as we leave for home because we were unsure of the weather 
                    at night.</p>
                  <p>We informed the Physical Facilities Office that they need 
                    to send someone over to repair the damages in our room. In 
                    addition to the computers, five of our fluorescent lights 
                    went out. They told us that people were already going around 
                    the whole building to check affected areas.</p>
                  <p>It has been a week now since we have yet to see the men going 
                    around. The joke here is, &#8220;Maybe that is why it is not 
                    being fixed. Maybe the men were doing just that&#8230; &#8220;GOING 
                    AROUND.&#8221; Should we just wait around until the next storm 
                    hits us and the whole ceiling collapses?</p>
