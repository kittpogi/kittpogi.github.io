    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">The year is defined as being the interval between two successive passages
of the Sun through the vernal equinox. Of course, what is really occurring
is that the Earth is going around the Sun but it is easier to understand what 
is happening by considering the apparent motion of the Sun in the sky. </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">The vernal equinox is the instant when the Sun is above the Earth's equator
while going from the south to the north. It is the time which astronomers
take as the definition of the beginning of Spring. The year as defined above 
is called the tropical year and it is the year length that defines the repetition 
of the seasons. The length of the tropical year is 365.24219 days. </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 46 BC Julius Caesar established the Julian calendar which was used in
the west until 1582. In the Julian calendar each year contained 12 months
and there were an average of 365.25 days in a year. This was achieved by 
having three years containing 365 days and one year containing 366 days. 
(In fact the leap years were not correctly inserted until 8 AD). The 
discrepancy between the actual length of the year, 365.24219 days, and 
the adopted length, 365.25 days, may not seem important but over hundreds 
of years the difference becomes obvious. The reason for this is that the
seasons, which depend on the date in the tropical year, were getting
progressively out of kilter with the calendar date. Pope Gregory XIII, in
1582, instituted the Gregorian calendar, which has been used since then. 
The change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian involved the change 
of the simple rule for leap-years to the more complex one in which century 
years should only be leap-years if they were divisible by 400. For example, 
1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap-years whereas 2000 will be. The net effect 
is to make the adopted average length of the year 365.2425 days.
The difference between this and the true length will not have a serious
effect for many thousands of years. (The error amounts to about 3 days in
10,000 years.) The adoption of the Gregorian calendar was made in Catholic 
countries in 1582 with the elimination of 10 days, October the 4th being 
followed by October 15th. The Gregorian calendar also stipulated that the 
year should start on January 1. In non-Catholic countries the change was 
made later; Britain and her colonies made the change in 1752 when 
September 2nd was followed by September 14 and New Year's Day was
changed from March 25 to January 1. </font></pre>

    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Jesuit astronomer Christopher Clavius helped Pope Gregory XIII to
introduce what is now called the Gregorian calendar. </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Julian leap-year rule created 3 leap years too many in every period of
385 years. As a result, the actual occurrence of the equinoxes and
solstices slowly moved away from their calendar dates.
The date of the spring equinox determines the date of Easter so the church
began to press for reform. </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clavius proposed that Wednesday, Oct. 4, 1582 (Julian) should be followed
by Thursday, Oct. 15, 1582 (Gregorian). He proposed that leap years occur
in years exactly divisible by four, except
that years ending in 00 must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This
rule is still used today and is so accurate that no further reform of the
calendar will be necessary for many centuries. </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">Viete did not like Clavius's calendar and the people of Frankfurt rioted
against mathematicians and the Pope who, they believed had conspired
together to rob them of 11 days. </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although Clavius produced little mathematics of his own he did more than
any other German scholar of the 16C to promote a knowledge of mathematics.
He was the first, however to use the decimal point. </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">He was a gifted teacher and writer of textbooks. His arithmetic books were
used by many mathematicians including Leibniz and Descartes.
