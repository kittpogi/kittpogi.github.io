          of all agreement. It is the &quot;glue&quot; of teamwork and the bridge 
          of human relationship. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Whether 
          you are in a committed relationship, leading a management team, running 
          a business, parenting children, or negotiating a deal, your ability 
          to understand, to BE understood and to create harmony, depends on your 
          ability to master some of the basic laws of communication. </font></p>
        <p> <font face="OzHandicraft BT" size="5" color="#C7930A"><strong>KNOW 
          YOUR PERSONAL POWER TO INFLUENCE</strong></font> <font
face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
          Communication itself is your true personal power. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Our 
          world is nothing but a mass of earth, air and chemicals - if it were 
          not for human exchange and communication. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">All 
          of our present day ideas, products, rules and rituals have been created 
          through cooperation and relationship and that stems first from our communication. 
          </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Someone, somewhere, beginning 
          a thought and COMMUNICATING it with another, CREATES our world. So, 
          to be your most powerful communicator that you are, know and BELIEVE 
          that your communication itself is POWER. (and respect the &quot;power&quot; 
          of others to create this way also)</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">If 
          you want to change ANYTHING in your life, to have more money, to have 
          a great relationship, or to effect positive change around you, your 
          COMMUNICATION can CREATE it. It can bring things into EXISTENCE.</font> 
          <font face="Verdana" size="2">Mastering the sending and receiving (the 
          exchange) elements of Communication lets you influence your world where 
          no obstacle can ever block you from what you desire.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="OzHandicraft BT" size="5" color="#C7930A"><strong>LISTEN... 
          AND RECEIVE</strong></font> <font
face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
          Most people's greatest desire is simply...to be heard, to be understood, 
          and to be accepted. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Communication 
          is a relay game. Too often, communication blocks happen when BOTH parties 
          maintain a position that each needs to be heard FIRST. When you let 
          go of that, the other person feels an instant increase in trust with 
          you. By listening first before you talk, you are RECEIVING the communication 
          they are sending and that &quot;empties their cup&quot; so that they 
          can hear YOU.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">This does not mean 
          to simply &quot;let them finish&quot;. Rather, it means to clearly UNDERSTAND 
          the other's position. Ask questions of them, acknowledge what is being 
          said to you (don't comment on it but reflect it and acknowledge it) 
          and show them you are getting their point.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Remember 
          that communication only happens when it is RECEIVED. Do what you need 
          to do to receive it clearly and fully and you will open up the channel 
          to even more productive exchange.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="OzHandicraft BT" size="5" color="#C7930A"><strong>ACKNOWLEDGE 
          COMMUNICATION</strong></font><font
face="Verdana" size="2"> <br>
          Receiving communication also means &quot;signaling&quot; that you received 
          it as well.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Communication... is 
          a response! (if you speak in an empty forest and no one hears you it 
          is NOT communication is it?). </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">So, 
          ACKNOWLEDGE what is being said to you before you respond to it (with 
          your opinion or counter opinion). This can be as simple as nodding your 
          head, uttering &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;uh huh&quot; or &quot;I can see 
          what you mean&quot; as the other person makes a point of what they are 
          saying. (Mastering this one skill can make you a master of online chats 
          as well! People rarely acknowledge communication in an online chat)</font> 
          <font face="Verdana" size="2">This is also PARTICULARLY TRUE when people 
          are upset. Especially when dealing with an irate customer. Think about 
          the last time you received poor treatment in customer service and all 
          you wanted was someone to listen to your issues. If the irate person 
          is your customer, hear them out and ACKNOWLEDGE them before you defend 
          your company's position - or even before you try to right the wrong. 
          </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Since there is no greater desire 
          than the desire to be heard (and it is rare that people take the time 
          to really acknowledge what we think), when you do that for others you 
          will gain immediate and tangible results in the form of trust and respect.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="OzHandicraft BT" size="5" color="#C7930A"><strong>CLARIFY 
          AND CONFIRM YOUR COMMUNICATION</strong></font> <font
face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
          In the same thinking, whenever you complete a significant business meeting 
          or whenever you resolve an upset in a personal relationship, be proactive 
          about CONFIRMING whether your communication was RECEIVED. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Don't 
          assume just because you said it (or...that you SENT it) that it was 
          understood. ASK the other person if you can review what you both covered 
          in the communication before you leave it. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Example: 
          &quot;Okay, just so I understand this, we are going to resolve this 
          (situation) this way, is that right? or..is it that way ?&quot;</font> 
          <font face="Verdana" size="2">Example: &quot;So, you're going to pick 
          up the kids at 5:00 and I am going to do the dinner. Is that right?&quot; 
          ( No one can say you didn't say what you did if you take the time to 
          confirm like this)</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Sure, most times 
          you can speak in shorthand with people you know very Well and you might 
          not find this necessary. But, if you are finding that there are missed 
          signals, and misunderstandings happening, it is usually because both 
          parties are not clarifying their communication beforehand.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">You 
          will be surprised when you do this how often what we ASSUME people understand 
          is so very far from what they DO understand. Asking to review the communication 
          will prevent upsets in the future as you both clarify what is needed.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> </font><font face="OzHandicraft BT" size="5"
color="#C7930A"><strong>IDENTIFY AND CONFRONT YOUR ASSUMPTIONS/BELIEFS</strong></font> 
          <font
face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
          Too often today, in this &quot;enlightened&quot; &quot;politically correct&quot; 
          world we live in, we think it is &quot;bad&quot; to judge or to make 
          assumptions about people, their actions or intentions. But, assumptions 
          are an important part of our daily real-world interactions. </font> 
          <font face="Verdana" size="2">Without them, we would never get through 
          the simplest tasks of team work and cooperation. Interpretation is a 
          normal part of communication. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
          problems with judgements and beliefs comes when we don't recognize them 
          as...just that, beliefs and interpretations. When we try to present 
          them as facts to ourselves or others, we cloud communication.</font> 
          <font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's take a simple example. Let's say 
          that you send someone an email asking a question. Let's also assume 
          that they don't answer it promptly and you notice they have seemed to 
          avoid you in other respects as well. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">It 
          would not be out of the ordinary for you to wonder about that. Now, 
          you could assume, say, that the person is...shy...or that they are...insensitive...or 
          that they, perhaps, just don't take a shine to you for some reason. 
          Why knows? All assumptions are equal here.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">But 
          if you need to have prompt communication with this person, it needs 
          to be resolved, right? So, confront this by openly expressing your suspicions 
          and ASKING the person if there is such a problem. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, 
          often a person asked is there a problem will respond &quot;No, there 
          is no problem.&quot; It is as automatic as &quot;How are you?&quot; 
          &quot;I am fine&quot;, etc. If they do answer that way, simply say (following 
          this example), &quot;Well, I have noticed you haven't been able to answer 
          my communication and that it has happened like this before and I was 
          even thinking ... (SHARE with them whatever you assume) ...am I correct?&quot;</font> 
          <font face="Verdana" size="2">This gives them a chance to acknowledge 
          you, the situation, and what is really going on for them. Obviously 
          this is a small and trite example but the principle holds for any kind 
          of assumption belief. It is part of communication and all communication 
          needs to be acknowledged.</font></p>

          When there is a problem, confront it. </font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Look 
          up that word in the dictionary and it will show you a very different 
          meaning than most of us assume. When faced with an issue to resolve 
          with someone else, if we don't like confrontations we say, &quot;I don't 
          want a confrontation&quot;, etc.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">However, 
          if you look at the word confront, it means to FACE something. (con-front 
          to be in &quot;front of&quot;) When we confront a situation, we actually 
          DIFFUSE it through communication.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">NOT 
          confronting it actually CAUSES CONFRONTATIONS. They happen because when 
          the issues are real, the &quot;facing of it&quot; is inevitable. </font> 
          <font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately when it happens at a stress/breaking 
          point and people lose control, we get a &quot;confrontation and the
