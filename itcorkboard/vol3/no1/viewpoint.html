                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Fun, 
                    cooperation, tiring, team spirit, exciting, challenging, bonding, 
                    good food, bloopers, learning experience. Those are the words 
                    I can link with the recently concluded ITC Day. Since it was 
                    the first time the IT Center hosted such event, the ITPs were 
                    quite uncertain of what to expect from the visitors; many 
                    had a degree of apprehension whether or not the visitors will 
                    appreciate the activities and exhibits. Having a good foresight, 
                    the Team Building Committee prepared an online survey to be 
                    accomplished by the visitors after viewing the whole exhibit. 
                    The survey aimed to gather the visitors' opinion on the ITC 
                    Day. I guess, the result of this survey will most probably 
                    determine whether the ITPs should look forward to another 
                    ITC Day come June 2002 or just consider the whole idea as 
                    part of ITC's history. Well, let's see what the survey said&#133;</font></p>

                  </table>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">First, 
                    it was a relief to know that only a single soul found the 
                    ITC Day boring. Interesting, high-tech and exciting were how 
                    the visitors noted the event. A few said it was captivating 
                    and enlightening. These adjectives only made certain that 
                    all our preparations for that day were not in vain. The 38 
                    visitors who participated in the survey, to a varying degree, 
                    appreciated the displays, exhibits, demonstrations, and the 
                    event as a whole. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Second, 
                    it was saddening to know that more than half of the respondents 
                    did not know that ITC developed information systems, acquired 
                    and allocated computer facilities, and designed and maintained 
                    the DLSU web sites. Maybe this same half were also the ones 
                    who were not aware that ITC was the one behind the DLSU Web 
                    Sites, WISe, Active Desktop, Online Survey System, IDA, FAM, 
                    Help Desk System, and My.Lasalle. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">And 
                    finally, what the visitors would remember the most during 
                    the ITC Day? Do I hear food? Well, if food was included in 
                    the survey, it might have taken the highest rating. Please 
                    take note, the highest rate went to the PowerPoint presentation 
                    on the History of ITC - Our Story, ITC (ehem, ehem&#133; did 
                    anyone see how many times I voted? <font face="Wingdings">J</font>). 
                    Kidding aside, I guess many would agree that it was a real 
                    neat presentation and the trivia quiz was quite amusing (I 
                    wish I was not the one assigned to write this article&#133; 
                    well, too much for that &quot;egotistic&quot; tendencies). 
                    Tied on the second spot were the Evolution of DLSU Web Sites 
                    and Video Clips of Interviews. Well, well, find something 
                    in common from these exhibits? The Docu Office authored them 
                    all! What can I say, Docu people have a real sense of artistry! 
                    But wait, let's also give a round of applause for the exhibit 
                    on Evolution of Computer Media which ranked third. In fairness 
                    to other exhibitors, I'm sure everyone did their best and 
                    should be given due credit. Unfortunately, the posters were 
                    not given much attention. The IDA system was the highest rater 
                    in the product demo category. For the pride and joy of the 
                    one who performed the demo, other demos did not come close 
                    to IDA. On the other hand, I think the video conferencing 
                    should have been a big hit that day only if those assigned 
                    to that demo were a little more zealous in presenting the 
                    technology. So next time, try to learn some marketing tricks, 
                    and it really helps having a mascot <font face="Wingdings">J</font>.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">To 
                    round it all up, I think the ITC Day was a good idea to boost 
                    up the consciousness of the DLSU community on what the Center 
                    really does. That we don't just sit here pounding our keyboards 
                    for nothing. The event was a modest way of showing that we 
                    are doing a great deal of clever work. If many are not aware 
                    of our good products and services, where do the credits go? 
                    A student even asked me if our web pages are being paid per 
                    page. Obviously, he doesn't know that it was ITC's talented 
                    Web Development Team who creates and maintains the DLSU websites. 
                    We should not allow ourselves to accept only blames (for a 
                    slow internet connection, unavailable site, and crashing systems). 
                    Once in a while, we should also show them that there are a 
                    lot of good cooking going on here in ITC. Way to go ITC!</font></p>
