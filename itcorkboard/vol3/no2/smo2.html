                    through my veins. Though this feeling was nothing new to me, 
                    having been to different jobs before, there was definitely 
                    something different with ITC. Could it be the fact that it 
                    was miles away from home? Or maybe because I was still on

                    I be judged because of where I studied? Would there be any 
                    discrimination? Would I even be accepted? These questions

                    working in ITC, you will be surrounded by real people who 
                    will accept you for who you are. Come to think of it, ITC

                    the practicum program. The Friday night activities that made 
                    us smile and put joy into our hearts. The free meriendas that 
                    filled our hungry stomachs, and the times when SMO forgot 
                    to invite us when there are free food (always). </font></p>

                    she learned all in a day. While Aimee, a hustler in playing 
                    pusoy dos, learned to play tong-its in the office. </font></p>

                    humors like sir Harold throwing jokes on Sir Brian, call names

                    on Sir Johnny when he was interviewed by Philippine Star, 
                    and many others. <br>

                    In our stay with ITC, we learned many things that will be 
                    of importance when we graduate and work outside. We experienced 
                    how it felt to work at home and in the office. Because of 
                    this, we will be better equipped as students and as individuals. 
                    Our deepest and sincerest thanks to everybody for making this
