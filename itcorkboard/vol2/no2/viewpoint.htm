          DLSU web development team has spent three gruesome months in rehashing 
          the DLSU website.&nbsp; It started from an exhausting brainstorming 
          on how the site can be presented to surfers considering their various 
          interests. After the brainstorming, the layout was designed, information 
          gathered, and then the transfer started.&nbsp; Transfer did not go uncomplicated 
          since script hitches and content scrapes arise one after the other.&nbsp; 
          Fume even steamed-up inevitably among the team members as they feel 
          the pressure of the deadline and the stress of darning numerous slip-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> After the uphill struggle with time
      and transformation complexities, the Web Development Team, headed by Ms.
      Celine Rivera, finally blurted out a big sigh of relief and proudly presented the new face of DLSU on the web.&nbsp;
      But no
      24-hours had passed when the mailboxes of the team was filled to the
      brim.&nbsp; Congratulations, violent reactions, suggestions, corrections
      and whatever &quot;-tions&quot; have you, paraded in the e-mails of the
      Docu staff.&nbsp; What the team thought as conclusion of the project
      proved to be only a halfway mark down the finish line.&nbsp; And to make
      things a little 'stiff' for the team, reactions do not go in unison
      (well, of course it's natural).&nbsp; Others were very much delighted with
      the controversial splash page, others were not so much pleased.&nbsp;
      Truly, after having the new DLSU site on-line, another series of meetings,
      discussions, and editings crammed the schedules of the Documentation
      Office... until today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the contrary, this article was not
      written to gripe and express disappointment, in fact, the Team wanted to
      acknowledge those who gave their feedbacks since it is only through these
      will we know that we are able to consider the varied interests of surfers,
      check on the flaws, and reconsider other matters to really make the site a
      reflection of a world-class university that is DLSU.</font></p>

          the office when the new DLSU site went on-line... the graduating girl 
          on the Splash page.&nbsp; If you were not able to take a look at her, 
          well, here she is again.&nbsp; FYI, she has already been replaced-by

I'm Jolina Mallari, President of the Student Council and I would just like to say that the new format of the webpage is fabulous. I would like to commend the web development team on that. However, I do have some suggestions. May I request that the e-mail of the SC (scpresident@edsamail.com.ph) be included for those who wish to contact the Student Council. Also, I noticed that the info on the student handbook is from the old one and not the new. This, I think can cause some confusion among the students.
That's it. Thank you for your time.
________________________________________
first of all, CONGRATULATIONS FOR A GREAT WEB SITE! it's truly WORLD-CLASS!!! pls make the changes real fast. people expect this from us as the errors are remembered for a long time. as a general guideline, pls ALWAYS keep in mind that this is our virtual billboard...for advertising what's in dlsu; what's best in dlsu; and why dlsu is the best. as web developers, we have this opportunity to contribute to the public relations of dlsu system. so let's put all good points / achievements to the appropriate web pages. 

_________________________________________
On our new website design, congratulations! Its really nice, attractive,and interesting.My only comment is that some of the words escape the viewer either because of the movement or because the words tend to be blurred.please congratulate those who worked hard on this, for me.
_________________________________________
the new dlsu site has made a lot of improvements toward the effective use of its web presence. the pages are more navigable and easy to use. however the constant introductions being shown upon entering the site is getting to be an irritant more than an object of admiration among us students. an educational institution should dedicate its efforts more on content rather than flashy marketing schemes. An example of a good, professional site would be the andersen consulting, arthur andersen web pages. We would like to suggest that flash and shockwave objects be integrated with the content itself rather than on the doorstep. Thank you very much.
_________________________________________
On this:
 the new design of the DLSU web site is now online. please email us your comments/corrections. Congratulations for an excellent job! However, I'd like to make some corrections under my office:
My name: Yolando instead of Rolando
The IFD director is Ms. Debbie Ann P. Nacu

My reactions: 
The splash sequence looks great. But it takes too much time to play. Of course, you are using this to load the home page. But perhaps getting to the home page can be faster. 
If you want to put more marketing elements in the splash sequence, you can make the Think It.... sequence shorter and put more come-ons as part of the loading time. Example: Free Regristration Forms! Early Enrolment! New Programs Launched! Scholarships Available! Online Graduate Courses! etc. I think these marketing handles will appeal more to non-La Salle users who, I suspect, check out our Website more than members of our academic community. People want to know how they can get in our school or avail of our programs. I realize, though, that some of the info I put up may not be available (i.e., registration forms or enrolment). But I think you get the idea from an ad point of view what kind of banner headlines grab a visiting user's attention and keeps him or her glued to the site. 
As it is now, the Website looks like an electronic catalog of who we are. Perhaps the info can be secondary to the more primary consideration of reaching out to more people. 
_________________________________________
i'm suggesting to the web development team to include in the home page (front/main page) FUTURE events like:
ccs national computer conference (or something)
- dec 2000
- pls ask ccs
la salle 2001 (sequel to LS2K)
- jan 26, 2001
- pls ask spsmeb
aun conference/meeting
- nov 2000?
major student events like SC election, recruitment week for student organizations, et al
- once we have the specific dates
- maybe just a month in advance 
other conferences/seminars organized by dlsu
- as early as possible
...looking forward into the future to leverage on advertising on the web. besides, these events need it and it's good for dlsu's image -- System-wide.
_________________________________________
 Congratulations to you and your people for such an impressive website (as though the previous one was not good enough). We're truly proud of ITC! I noted some very minor corrections on the Admissions website which Susan will forward to the one in-charge. More power to you all.
_________________________________________
I had a brief look at the new website page. It appears that the webpage intro in mainly for student applicants and those planning to enter DLSU. It has the beat and look for the younger set - and I think it is best placed in the Admissions website. As of the moment, the intro page is very choppy (as Rico says). Also the next page where the top of the frame puts "the future begins here". That line is also very choppy with many numbers and figures coming out before the line comes on.
However, those visiting our website wishing to know about our university (e.g. research, faculty, publications, etc.) are no longer interested in the 'marketing' aspect of "live it, Believe it, etc." I know that you have placed an option of "skip the introduction" but this can be bothersome because it takes some time before the 'skip the intro' button comes out. It is too market oriented (almost a hard sell, you might say). I guess this is fine in the admissions page but not in the main website page. Just imagine a person needing to access our website several times to get info. He/she will have to go through this "intro" everytime he/she hits the site. It can be a cause of irritation.
My opinion may be more conservative but I would like to project DLSU as a comprehensive university with solid research, faculty, students, and facilities. Many of those browsing the university websites are not interested in entering DLSU as freshmen. If desired, we can also have a similar video/audio about DLSU but addressed to the general public.
_________________________________________
To the Webmaster:
We would like to request to please update the http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/colleges/ page. Could you put a note, in the Colleges page, that CCS is a Center of Development for Excellence in Information Technology (as the other colleges e.g., COS, were noted as being centers of excellence in various fields)? 
Good day and great job on the web page. Really looks nice.
