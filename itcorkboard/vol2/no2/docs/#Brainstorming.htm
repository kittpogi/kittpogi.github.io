      <TD width=272><FONT size=+2>B</FONT>rainstorming can be an effective way 
        to generate lots of ideas and then determine which idea(s) best solves 
        the problem. Brainstorming is most effective with larger groups of 
        people and should be performed in a relaxed environment. If participants 
        feel free to be silly, they'll stretch their minds more and therefore 
        produce more creative ideas. <BR><BR>In order to brainstorm, you will 
        need either a chalkboard (if there are any still left in the world), 
        white-board or <A

          <LI>Define your problem (please note that the word "problem" is not 
          necessarily negative - your problem could be "We need a new product 
          for the Christmas season" or "How can we effectively use our 
          departmental budget surplus for this year?"). Write out your problem 
          concisely and make sure that everyone understands the problem and is 
          in agreement with the way it is worded. There is no need to put a lot 
          of restrictions on your problem at this time. <BR><BR>
          <LI>Give yourselves a time limit - we recommend around 25 minutes, but 
          experience will show how much time is required. Larger groups may need 
          more time to get everyone's ideas out. <BR><BR>
          <LI>Everyone must shout out solutions to the problem while one person 
          writes them out or enters them into BrainStormer. There must be 
          ABSOLUTELY NO CRITICIZING OF IDEAS. No matter how daft, how impossible 
          or how silly an idea is, it must be written down. Laughing is to be 
          encouraged. Criticism is not. Why? Because you want to encourage the 
          free flow of ideas and as soon as participants of the brainstorming 
          session begin to fear criticism of their ideas, they'll stop 
          generating ideas. Moreover, Ideas that first seem silly may prove to 
          be very good or may lead to ideas that are very good. <BR><BR>
          <LI>Once your time is up, select the five ideas which you like best. 
          Make sure everyone involved in the brainstorming session is in 
          agreement. <BR><BR>
          <LI>Write down about five criteria for judging which ideas best solve 
          your problem. Criteria should start with the word "should", for 
          example, "it should be cost effective", "it should be legal", "it 
          should be possible to finish before July 15", etc. <BR><BR>
          <LI>Give each idea a score of 0 to 5 points depending on how well it 
          meets each criterion. Once all of the ideas have been scored for each 
          criterion, add up the scores. <BR><BR>
          <LI>The idea with the highest score will best solve your problem. But 
          you should keep a record of all of your best ideas and their scores in 
          case your best idea turns out not to be workable. </LI></OL>
