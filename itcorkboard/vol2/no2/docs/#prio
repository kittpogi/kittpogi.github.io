After the storm of Fernando Carillo (FC) ever wondered how PRIO faired with him? If FC made every one go \'93agaga\'94 during his recent concert stint in Manila \'85
 PRIO made the PRIT members of Adjustment as well as every students who are adjusting a bit more comfortable during the last concluded two day Adjustment. I guess with the tandem of our own version of Fernando Mamarillo a.k.a. JGK and Thalia y Rosalinda a
.k.a PBA we could safely say that we also give entertainment to where it is much needed by the people we want to serve. Of course this would have not been possible without the help and support of their manager Boss del Rosario a.k.a A}{\ul D}{S.

\par \tab Aside from the concert of FC \'85
 he also did some interviews and sky diving drills. How about our Fernando Mamarillo? Well, he made his debut project with WIMO. Now he is still getting some much-needed data to plot out the project. Part of the support extended to him by the 
Boss was giving WIMO their Basic TQM training to level everyone with the goal of the University. And recently he just had his weeklong trainings. Did he meet the girl of his dream there\'85 better check the glow in his eyes!

Trisha, she also went with Fernando Mamarillo on the weeklong training. She is still busy with her Adjustment write-up. Wait for all the new updates for this\'85
 she is very persistent in targeting to finish this project this term. Why is she that persistent?
 Well, the Boss gave a challenging task to PRIO that is now called the PSI project. The goal of the project is for PSI to set up its own system. Imagine this task to be targetted this December!?! Well, it may be too big a project to finish but somehow PRI
O will manage this smoothly\'85 right guys!?!
