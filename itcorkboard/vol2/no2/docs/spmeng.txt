things to check:

...aside from the basic subject-predicate agreement.

1. consistency (in sentences, paragraphs, sections, et al)
    - singular or plural
    - present, future, or past
    - active or passive voice
    - e.g., use "enrol" (french spelling) _or_ "enroll" (american
      spelling) but not both...even though both are correct.

2. using numbers in documentation (excluding flowcharts)
    - e.g., one (1) object

3. antecedent of pronouns
    - e.g., The clerk fills out the form and checks that 
            his/her ID number is correct.
            ...sometimes, "its" (not used for persons)
             is used instead of his/her (used for persons)

4. hyphenation
    - follow-up = adjective, noun, or adverb
      e.g., follow-up interview; filled-out form
    - follow up = verb
      e.g., he followed up (or follows up) the document
      i'm not really sure if there's a hyphenated verb.

5. use of comma and semi-colon
    - after e.g. and i.e.
        => e.g., one, two, and three.
    - series (same for "and" and "or")
        => They are Peter, James, and John.
        => His functions are washing the dishes; scrubbing the
           floor; and cleaning the windows.

6. use active voice in flowcharts, procedures, and instructions
   ...2nd person (i.e., "you" perspective instead of "he/she") 
      when applicable
   - e.g., get the Form-A

7. for procedures, use simple terms.
   - don't use "per" unless you mean "every" or "each"
   - ensure that things will not be misinterpreted
   - assume a reader with "little or no knowledge"
   - KISS - keep is simple silly
     originally, "keep it simple stupid"...those americans.  :)

8. capitalization
   - e.g., university is a common noun.  but when we pertain it
     to a specific institution (like DLSU), capitalize it.
     something like...

     ISTC is the...De La Salle University.  Its role in the
     University is...  Next school year, the Center will be...

     - center is capitalized because it pertains to a proper
       noun already.

9. it's and its
   - "it's" - an abbreviation of "it is"
   - its - means ownership by something
           e.g., its color - means the color of "it"

of course, english is really a dynamic (or weird, as some would put
it) language.  the above tips are strict/formal implementation of
grammar rules.  slang, informal, or IT forms (e.g., backup and
database) sometimes become accepted into the formal version.  well, at
least IT words/terms in IT documents.

for example, there's no such word as "etc." formally, that is.  this
is why "et al" or "et cetera" is used.  but so many use "etc." (for
convenience), it became accepted...dunno yet if it's considered a
"formal" abbreviation already.

thanks.
