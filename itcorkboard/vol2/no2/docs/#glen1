\par }{\fs22 Recently, two classrooms, one computer lab under the IT Center and another belonging to Behavioral Science Department, had one interesting new getup. The multimedia projectors of these rooms had been uniquely setup above, on the ceiling. 
\par 
\par Placing the projectors above everyone gives it a more space-saving, convenient and not to mention secured, perspective. Giving the faculty a good-enough space to work around the classroom to check if everyone understands the lesson.a
nd the students, a much clearer picture, since they don\rquote t have to worry about not seeing the projection especially if the speaker is blocking the projector.
\par 
\par With this development, and with the successful implementation of the project, not only will the other Computer Labs have this kind of setup but also the Conference Rooms within the campus. It\rquote 
s all just a matter of time before this vision is realized and established. So to all who took part in the implementation of this project (you all know who you are) keep up the good work!
