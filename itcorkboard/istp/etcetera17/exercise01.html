 <font size="1"><i>                 Contributed

                  <p> <img src="images/ofc_exc.jpg" width="200" height="212" align="left">Being 
                    physically inactive is as damaging to health as smoking cigarettes. 
                    A majority of people shun smoking because of the health implications. 
                    Why, then, aren't more people willing to exercise?</p>
                  <p>Part of the reason may be the word "exercise." Exercise seems 
                    to imply rigid, "no-fun" workouts that make us huff and puff 
                    and sweat. Workouts also can be time-consuming It is hard 
                    to find time in a busy day to go to a gym, change, work out, 
                    shower, change again, and drive home. Unfortunately, many 
                    people view exercise as an impractical burden that complicates 
                    rather than complements a busy life.</p>
                  <p>However, there is another option. Moderate physical activities 
                    like brisk walking can promote health nearly as much as vigorous 
                    workouts. This means we can set aside the boot-camp mentality 
                    in favor of physical activities that are less demanding and 
                    more enjoyable.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Make Workouts Work</strong>. Softening the rules 
                    doesn't mean you can play checkers on your lunch hour to satisfy 
                    your body's need for physical activity. You need to get at 
                    least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity that involves 
                    moving your whole body daily. Try some of these tips on fitting 
                    exercise into your busy day. </p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#0000FF">Commit yourself</font></em><font color="#0000FF">.</font> 
                    You owe it to yourself and to your family to be as healthy 
                    as you can be. Committing to daily physical activities is 
                    an important part of a healthy lifestyle. </p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#0000FF">Goal for it</font></em>. Set short-term 
                    and long-term goals. A short-term goal could be starting from 
                    scratch and adding a minute a day to your exercise regimen. 
                    A long-term goal could be losing weight or lowering your blood 
                    pressure. </p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#0000FF">Break it up</font></em><font color="#0000FF">.</font> 
                    Exercise doesn't have to be structured. Busy people can get 
                    much the same benefits when they exercise in bits and pieces 
                    throughout the day as when they work out in one block of time. 
                  </p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#0000FF">Pencil yourself in</font></em>. 
                    On especially busy days, you may not be able to spontaneously 
                    get a minimal amount of physical activity, so you need to 
                    plan ahead. Pencil in an exercise appointment, and consider 
                    it a mandatory meeting. </p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#0000FF"><img src="images/dumbell.jpg" width="150" height="179" align="right">Avoid 
                    the all-or-nothing trap</font></em>. If circumstances prevent 
                    you from doing everything you planned for the day, do what 
                    you can and don't worry about it. Tomorrow is a new day with 
                    new opportunities to exercise. Keep perspective. If you fall 
                    off your routine for a time because of injury or illness, 
                    just get back on. Interruptions are part of life. Be realistic. 
                    Don't focus on exercises you find unpleasant or uncomfortable. 
                    Choosing activities you enjoy will help you stick with your 
                    program. </p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#0000FF">Gear up</font></em>. Spontaneous 
                    exercise may depend on having walking shoes or a change of 
                    clothes available. </p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#0000FF">Have equipment on hand</font></em><font color="#0000FF">.</font> 
                    Buy a piece of exercise equipment, place it in a convenient 
                    location at home, and jump on it when you have a few minutes 
                    to spare. </p>
                  <p> <em><font color="#0000FF">Recruit a friend</font></em><font color="#0000FF">.</font> 
                    Engaging in physical activities together is a good way to 
                    keep a friendship alive. </p>
                  <p><em><font color="#0000FF">Jump on spare time</font></em><font color="#0000FF">.</font> 
                    On weekends or other "down time," take a long walk or hike 
                    in the woods. </p>
                  <p><em><font color="#0000FF">Balance your workouts</font></em><font color="#0000FF">.</font> 
                    New guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine 
                    suggest three to five days of aerobic workouts, two to three 
                    strength training sessions, and two to three flexibility workouts 
                    per week. You may need to work up to that level, but try to 
                    incorporate all three types of exercise into your week. Working 
                    three types of exercise into an already tight schedule may 
                    sound like a lot, but it may take less time than you think. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The aerobic workouts (like running, biking, or brisk walking) 
                    should ideally total 20 to 60 minutes a day. Strength training 
                    (also called weight lifting or weight training) should involve 
                    one set each of 8 to 10 exercises that work all major muscle 
                    groups. Flexibility exercises should stretch the major muscles 
                    throughout the body.</p>
                  <p>Create exercise. The possibilities for physical activity 
                    are limited only by your imagination.</p>
