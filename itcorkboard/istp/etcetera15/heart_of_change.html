                    <i><font size="1">by: Dan Cohen<br>
                    Contributed by: Samuel P. Mallare</font></i> 
                  <p> Changing hearts, as well as minds, is key to managing change 
                    around IT implementations. 
                  <p>Change is both our biggest challenge and our biggest ally 
                    in creating a better future. This is especially so in the 
                    area of IT. Technology adoption is fundamentally about change: 
                    new systems require new processes, new thinking and new ways 
                    of doing things. Yet, most leaders, IT or otherwise, do not 
                    lead or manage large-scale change well. As a result, many 
                    organisations fail to realise the full benefits of their implementations. 
                  </p>
                  <p> The single biggest challenge in any transformation is not 
                    culture, strategy or systems&#8212;but getting people to change 
                    their behaviour. We discovered a flow to successful change: 
                    eight fundamental steps that must be undertaken&#8212;usually, 
                    but not necessarily, in succession&#8212;in order to create 
                    a climate for change and to engage the whole organisation 
                    in supporting the transformation. In the most successful change 
                    efforts, people use the see-feel-change method to achieve 
                    behavioural change within each of these eight steps:</p>
                  <p><b>Step 1: Increase Urgency</b></p>
                  <p>Those who are most successful at significant change&#8212;whether 
                    CIOs at the top or small work groups at the bottom&#8212;begin 
                    by creating a sense of urgency among relevant people. Urgency 
                    is an energising force; it is what gets people on their toes 
                    and ready to move. Although logic, data and analysis are important 
                    for establishing why the organisation should change (and why 
                    management should invest large sums of money in the initiative), 
                    it does not have enough power to overcome the three primary 
                    feelings that undermine change: complacency, fear and anger. 
                  </p>
                  <p>That's why successful change leaders frequently use compelling, 
                    eye-catching, dramatic situations to show people what the 
                    problems are and to create an urgent, emotionally charged 
                    need to resolve them. Visualisations provide useful ideas 
                    that hit people at a deeper level than surface thinking. They 
                    evoke a visceral response that reduces emotions that block 
                    change (complacency, fear and anger) and enhance those that 
                    support it (urgency, optimism and faith).</p>
                  <p><b>Step 2: Build the Guiding Team</b></p>
                  <p>With urgency up, the more successful change leaders pull 
                    together a guiding team. This means assembling a group with 
                    the right characteristics &#8212; those with the authority 
                    to make required decisions and sufficient influence to garner 
                    essential resources. For instance, guiding team members in 
                    an IT implementation could range from the CIO to an influential 
                    end user to a savvy procurement manager.</p>
                  <p><b>Step 3: Get the Vision Right </b></p>
                  <p>In the most effective instances of large-scale change, the 
                    guiding team creates a clear and practical direction for the 
                    transformation. This means answering questions such as: What 
                    change is needed? What is our vision of the new organisation? 
                    What should not be altered? How is the best way to make the 
                    vision a reality? Far too often, guiding teams either set 
                    no clear direction or embrace visions that are not sensible. 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Step 4: Communicate for Buy-In</b></p>
                  <p>In successful change efforts, the leaders communicate the 
                    vision and strategies in simple, candid and heartfelt ways. 
                    Also, they communicate widely, ensuring that all levels of 
                    the organisation that are going to play a role in making the 
                    change happen are reached by a consistent message. After all, 
                    the ultimate goal is to get as many people as possible acting 
                    to make the vision a reality. </p>
                  <p>Many IT leaders under-communicate or communicate poorly without 
                    even knowing it. This is because too many people fail to see 
                    that good communication is not just data transfer. You need 
                    to show people something that addresses their anxieties, accepts 
                    their anger, that is credible in a very gut-level sense, and 
                    that evokes faith in the vision. </p>
                  <p><b>Step 5: Empower Action</b></p>
                  <p>In the best scenarios, change leaders empower people to take 
                    action. In this instance &quot;empower&quot; does not mean 
                    &quot;giving power&quot; and then walking away. Instead it 
                    means helping people to carry out the vision by removing obstacles 
                    &#8212; whether it's a disempowering boss, inadequate information 
                    and information systems or self-confidence barriers in people's 
                    minds. IT implementations often fail due to one of the most 
                    common emotions found in the business world today: frustration. 
                    When barriers are not removed on a timely basis, people often 
                    become so frustrated in their attempts to do things right 
                    that they give up. As a result, change is undermined.</p>
                  <p><b>Step 6: Create Short-Term Wins</b></p>
                  <p>In cases of great success, empowered people are helped to 
                    produce highly visible short-term wins. These well-publicised 
                    victories are critical to maintaining momentum in IT implementations 
                    because they reward hard work, produce a feeling of accomplishment 
                    and promote a sense of optimism. They also generate strong 
                    visible proof that the change is moving forward, which lays 
                    the groundwork for larger behavioural changes. Without incorporating 
                    quick, visible, short-term wins into their project plans, 
                    organisations run the risk of sinking their change efforts, 
                    as the cynics and sceptics take over the ship. </p>
                  <p><b>Step 7: Don't Let Up</b></p>
                  <p>As the old adage goes, &quot;It ain't over 'til it's over.&quot; 
                    In the best cases, change leaders don't let up; they continue 
                    with wave after wave of change until a complete transformation 
                    vision becomes a reality. After the first set of short-term 
                    wins, a change initiative should have direction and momentum. 
                    From there, effective leaders use this momentum to broaden 
                    the change effort. This means tackling the bigger and deeper 
                    changes to the organisation, such as realigning processes, 
                    technology and systems that will deliver the real benefits. 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Step 8: Making Change Stick</b></p>
                  <p>In the most successful change efforts, leaders throughout 
                    the organisation make change stick by anchoring it in a supportive 
                    culture. Many efforts fail, however, because leaders try to 
                    instantly create a new culture, but this is not how organisational 
                    dynamics work. A culture truly changes only when a new way 
                    of operating has been shown to succeed over some minimum period 
                    of time. To make change last, the new behaviour must be nurtured 
                    so that it becomes &quot;the way things are done&quot; in 
                    the organisation. In other words, norms of behaviour and shared 
                    values need to be reinforced and made part of both formal 
                    and informal systems. Then, slowly, a new organisational culture 
                    will take root. Without anchoring the change efforts in this 
                    new, supportive culture, the organisation runs the risk of 
                    sliding back into old habits and traditions with remarkable 
                    speed. </p>
