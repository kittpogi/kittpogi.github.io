                  <p><strong>A Reflection on Life</strong><br>
                    by: Celina Rivera</p>
                  <p>It all started when my husband, after receiving his approval 
                    of Australian citizenship, decided to leave for Australia 
                    to look for a job. Prior to this, his self-started software 
                    development firm folded up and he only had a handful of clients. 
                    Unfortunately, he was not that lucky to land a fulltime job 
                    after that. With kids fast growing up and education getting 
                    costlier, his decision was timely. At first, his life in Australia 
                    was not that easy, coping with a bout of homesickness, and 
                    getting odd jobs while waiting for a fulltime job. After two 
                    months, he did land one but he still had that desire to be 
                    with this family. Frankly, I was not comfortable with his 
                    decision to leave because I knew it would rock my peaceful 
                    life. I would be a mom and dad to my kids while still holding 
                    on to my job; and there was the decision that I too have to 
                    make when he does get us. </p>
                  <p>The last February, he came home bent on convincing me to 
                    file our family&#8217;s migration application. I spent sleepless 
                    nights thinking about what I have to give up &#8211; my career 
                    at DLSU, our house and other properties, the company of my 
                    relatives and friends, having a househelp, this country, and 
                    worse eventually my citizenship. I never really savored the 
                    thought of giving up my being a Filipino (how nationalistic!) 
                    But we prayed about it and thought if it&#8217;s not really 
                    God&#8217;s will, then this application will not progress. 
                    And my husband wanted me to explore this option by trying 
                    it out there before closing my door to this opportunity. So 
                    we agree that if I don&#8217;t like it there, or it would 
                    not be to our advantage to stay there for good, we&#8217;ll 
                    be coming back here.</p>
                  <p>Since then, I felt that my life was on a string, full of 
                    uncertainty. It&#8217;s as if you&#8217;re pregnant, you know 
                    that you&#8217;re about to give birth soon but don&#8217;t 
                    know when and you&#8217;re afraid of what will happen. Even 
                    the children&#8217;s enrolment was delayed because I wasn&#8217;t 
                    sure when the visa will be approved. Then last June 19, the 
                    inevitable came. We got the notice of the approval, three 
                    months after filing, and we had to be there by October. Not 
                    feeling very sure if it was really true, I went to the embassy 
                    to submit some forms and our passports. After about thirty 
                    minutes, my number was called and our passports were stamped!</p>
                  <p>I didn&#8217;t know if I would be happy or sad. Some would 
                    be ecstatic or excited because processing time was short (the 
                    maximum waiting time was nine months). My children were not 
                    that happy, too because they were just starting the school 
                    year and gaining new friends. I, too, was not very glad because 
                    I have to start thinking of arrangements for our house&#8217;s 
                    rental, disposal of our things, notification of my kids&#8217; 
                    schools and request for transfer documents, packing up, finishing 
                    work in the office and turning over work to my &#8220;replacement&#8221;, 
                    etc.</p>
                  <p>But I had to make a choice, between career and family, and 
                    for me, the latter came first. I wouldn&#8217;t want a &#8220;broken 
                    relationship&#8221; or much more, a &#8220;broken home&#8221;. 
                    Still I was having second thoughts even on the decision on 
                    our flight schedule. But God made me realize that it&#8217;s 
                    not really the date that mattered now but the feeling of not 
                    going because of too many attachments in my life. I guess 
                    if the objective of a decision is good, it will be God&#8217;s 
                    will. And God wants me to trust in Him, to give up these attachments, 
                    to risk everything, and to turn over to His hands the string 
                    that controls my life.</p>
                  <p>With my decision, I will miss DLSU where I&#8217;ve learned 
                    a lot and spent most of my waking hours from Monday to Friday 
                    for the last fifteen years. I will miss my friends whom I&#8217;ve 
                    gained through the years. I will miss the web development 
                    team whose creative passion and resourcefulness inspired me 
                    to lead them to produce outputs better than the last one it 
                    has done. I will miss the DAO people whom I enjoy discussing 
                    more technical stuff. I will miss the volleyball games, my 
                    once a year workout in the sports complex, and of course winning 
                    it. I will miss the ITC, (TGIH/F, the outings, Christmas party, 
                    etc.) where I&#8217;ve spent the best years of my life. One 
                    year of absence is quite long for me.</p>
                  <p>With a new country, culture, job and family conditions to 
                    face, I can see another chapter in my life unfolding before 
                    me. I have only the faith that God will always be there for 
                    us. I am not saying goodbye to the previous chapters. I am 
                    just putting a bookmark&#8230;.so I can come back again in 
                    the future.</p>
                  <p><strong><br>
                    An addendum&#8230;.<br>
                    (13 Oct 2003)</strong></p>
                  <p>It was drizzling on the morning of 27 Sept 2003 and the temperature 
                    was about 10 degrees Celsius. It was not a warm welcome after 
                    all! It was nice to breath in clean air but we felt the chill 
                    on our noses. We were met by a couple friend and we felt the 
                    icy cold climate despite our thick jackets. In the house we 
                    rented, we huddled in front of the heater. The kids said the 
                    airconditioning unit was on, 24 hours a day, in and out of 
                    the house.</p>
                  <p>So far, I find the people friendly, the transport system 
                    is so organized (bus/train/trams stops have exact schedules), 
                    food is cheap in proportion to the income, and schools accept 
                    children even in the last quarter of the school year. But 
                    the &#8220;walking distance&#8221; is far (a fifteen minute 
                    walk to the shops and market), shops close earlier than our 
                    malls in the Philippines and the kids find the nightlife very 
                    quiet (you don&#8217;t see people walking around the city 
                    when it gets dark, maybe because it&#8217;s too cold and they 
                    have no reason to hang out of their houses).</p>
                  <p>In a short time, I will be adjusting to the demands of this 
                    new life. I&#8217;ll be filling out another chapter and I 
                    hope I get enough experience to put in. Till next issue&#8230;..</p>
