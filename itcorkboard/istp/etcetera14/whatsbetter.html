                    graduates, you are just about to set sail into the real world. 
                    As you prepare for the battleground of life, you will hear 
                    many speeches, read tons of books, and get miles of advice 
                    telling you to work hard, dream big, go out and do something 
                    for yourself, and have a vision.</p>
                  <p> Not bad advice, really. In fact, following those nuggets 
                    of truth may just bring you to the top. But over the years, 
                    I have come to realize that it is great to dream big, have 
                    a vision, make a name, and work hard. But, guess what, THERE'S 
                    SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT.</p>
                  <p> So my message today simply asks the question, What's better 
                    than...?</p>
                  <p> Let us start off with something real simple. What's better 
                    than a long speech? No doubt, a short one. So, you guys are 
                    in luck because I do intend to keep this short.</p>
                  <p> Now, let me take you through a very simple math exam. I 
                    will rattle off a couple of equations, and you tell me what 
                    you observe about them. Be mindful of the instructions. You 
                    are to tell me what you OBSERVE about the equations. Here 
                    goes:</p>
                  <p> 3+4=7, 9+2=11, 8+4=13, and 6+6=12. Tell me, what do you 
                    observe.</p>
                  <p> Every time I conduct this test, more than 90 percent of 
                    the participants immediately say 8+4 is not 13 it is 12!</p>
                  <p> That is true and they are correct. But they could have also 
                    observed that the 3 other equations are right. That 3+4 is 
                    7, that 9+2 is 11, and that 6+6 is 12.</p>
                  <p> What is my point? Many people immediately focus on the negative 
                    instead of the positive. Most of us focus on what is wrong 
                    with people more than what is right about them. Examine those 
                    4 equations. 3 are right and only one is wrong. But what is 
                    the knee jerk observation? The wrong equation.</p>
                  <p> If people you did not know were to walk through that door, 
                    most of you would describe these people by what is negative 
                    about them. He's fat. He's balding. Oh, the short one. Oh 
                    the skinny girl. Ahhh, yung pango. Etc, etc, etc. Get the 
                    point?</p>
                  <p> You will definitely experience this in the corporate world. 
                    You do a hundred good things and make one mistake. Guess what, 
                    chances are, your attention will be called on that one mistake.</p>
                  <p> So what is better than focusing on the negative? Believe 
                    me, it is focusing on the positive more than the negative. 
                    You do that, and this world would be a much nicer place to 
                    live in.</p>
                  <p> <b>What's Better than Working Hard?</b></p>
                  <p> We have always been told to work hard. Our parents say that, 
                    our teachers say that, and our principal says that. But there 
                    is something better than merely working hard. It is working 
                    smart. It is taking time to understand the situation, and 
                    coming out with an effective and efficient solution to get 
                    more done with less time and effort. As the Japanese say, 
                    &quot;There's always a better way.&quot;</p>
                  <p> <b>What's Better than Dreaming Big</b></p>
                  <p> I will bet my next month's salary that many have encouraged 
                    you to DREAM BIG. Maybe even to reach for the stars and aim 
                    high. I sure heard that about a million times right before 
                    I graduated from this university. So I did. I did dream big. 
                    I did aim high. I did reach for the stars. There is no doubt 
                    it works. In fact, the saying is true: &quot;If you aim for 
                    nothing, that is exactly what you will hit... nothing.&quot;</p>
                  <p> But there's something better than dreaming big. Believe 
                    me, I was shocked myself. And I learned it from the biggest 
                    dreamer of all time, Walt Disney.</p>
                  <p> When it comes to dreaming big, Walt is the man. No bigger 
                    dreams were fulfilled than his. Every leadership book describes 
                    him as the ultimate dreamer. In fact, the principle of dreaming 
                    and achieving is the core message of the Disney hit song, 
                    &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star.&quot;</p>
                  <p> &quot;When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who 
                    you are; anything your heart desires will come to you. If 
                    your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme. When 
                    you wish upon a star, as dreamers do.&quot; - Jiminy Cricket.</p>
                  <p> But is that what he preached in the Disney Company? Dream? 
                    Well, not exactly. Kinda, but not quite. The problem with 
                    dreaming is if that is all you do, you get nowhere. In fact 
                    you may just fall asleep and never wake up.</p>
                  <p> The secret to Disney's success is not just dreaming, it 
                    is <b>IMAGINEERING</b>.</p>
                  <p> You will not find this word in a dictionary. It is purely 
                    Disney word. Those that engage in imagineering are called 
                    imagineers. The word combines the word imagination with engineering.</p>
                  <p> In the book, &quot;Imagineers&quot;, Disney's CEO, Michael 
                    Eisner claims that &quot;Imagineers turn impossible dreams 
                    into real magic.&quot; Walt Disney explains that there is 
                    really no secret to their approach. They just keep moving 
                    forward, opening new doors and doing new things, because they 
                    are curious. And it is this curiosity that leads them down 
                    new paths. They always dream, explore, and experiment. In 
                    short, IMAGINEERING is the blending of creative imagination 
                    and technical know-how.</p>
                  <p> Eisner expounds on this thought by saying that &quot;not 
                    only are imagineers curious, they are courageous, outrageous, 
                    and their creativity is contagious.&quot;</p>
                  <p> The difference with imagineers is that they dream and then 
                    they DO! So do not just be a dreamer, be an imagineer.</p>
                  <p> <b>What's Better than a Vision?</b></p>
                  <p> You must all have been given a lecture at one time or another 
                    about the importance of having a vision. Even leadership expert, 
                    John Maxwell, says that an indispensable quality of a leader 
                    is to have a vision. The Bible also makes it very clear: &quot;Without 
                    vision, people perish.&quot; So, no doubt about it, having 
                    a vision is important to success.</p>
                  <p> But surprise! There's something more potent that a vision... 
                    it is a CAUSE. If all you are doing is trying to reach your 
                    vision and you are pitted against someone fighting for a cause, 
                    chances are you will lose.</p>
                  <p> The Vietnam War is a classic example. Literally with sticks 
                    and stones, the Viet Cong beat the heavily armed US Army, 
                    primarily because the US had a vision to win the war but the 
                    Vietnamese were fighting for a cause.</p>
                  <p> Jesus had a rag tag &quot;army&quot; of 12 disciples against 
                    the pagan gods of the mighty Roman Empire. But they were able 
                    to turn the world around towards Christianity. How? They just 
                    did not have a vision to spread their faith; they were truly 
                    fighting for a cause.</p>
                  <p> In the realm of business, Sony founder Akio Morita did not 
                    just have a vision to build the biggest electronics company 
                    in the world. Read his biography, &quot;Made in Japan.&quot; 
                    He was fighting for a cause, and his cause was to help rebuild 
                    his country battered by a war. His vision to be an electronics 
                    giant was secondary.</p>
                  <p> So what's the difference between a vision and a cause? The 
                    following</p>
