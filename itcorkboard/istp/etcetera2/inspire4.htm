    WITHOUT THE AMEN</font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I was blessed with a wonderful mother,&quot;
    says David Moore, &quot;who taught me how to pray for all things, great and small and then
    to trust Him to answer in the way that was best for me.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">David says that as a boy he noticed that when his
    mother prayed, she never said, &quot;Amen&quot; at the end of her prayers. When he went to
    church and the pastor prayed, he always finished with a flourish and a hearty,
    &quot;Amen.&quot; That, of course, was the sign that the prayer was ended and it was time
    to head for the door or whatever. When others prayed they always signed off with an
    &quot;Amen,&quot; as a kind of spiritual radio station break signaling the conclusion of
    the whole matter. But not his mother, and it bothered David.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">One day he asked her, &quot;Mother, why don't you
    ever say Amen?&quot; And she answered, saying, &quot;I'm not through praying, and [saying]
    Amen denotes a conclusion to a prayer, and I'm not through yet. I am just pausing for a
    while.&quot; She explained, &quot;Jesus knows that I have many duties to perform and He
    doesn't mind waiting for a few minutes before we continue our conversation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">Is that Scriptural or what? When Paul wrote to the
    Thessalonians he told them to &quot;pray without ceasing&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:17,
    KJV). Another translation puts it, &quot;Pray continually&quot; and a third renders the
    text, &quot;Always keep on praying&quot; (Living Bible). Obviously Paul couldn't have
    meant that we should pray every waking moment. Even those who have entered cloisters and
    dedicated their lives to pray will tell you that it is impossible to focus on prayer every
    moment. Even the most dedicated will tell you that their minds wander, and their thoughts
    drift far astray.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">What this godly woman practiced is exactly what
    Paul had in mind. Live day by day, hour by hour, and minute by minute so that you are in
    touch with the Lord. Prayer is an attitude, an expression of your heart which finds
    expression in our words. But it goes far beyond the composed verbal expressions which we
    think of as prayers.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">After spending most of her life alone in Africa, a
    Scottish woman returned to her native Scotland. Mary Slessor was admired for her work, but
    friends began to talk among themselves. &quot;Have you noticed,&quot; said one, &quot;that
    she mumbles to herself almost all of the time?&quot; It seemed obvious to them that the
    loneliness and isolation had affected her mind. With the true loyalty of a friend who
    tells you about your social flaws, someone pointed out the fact that people were talking
    about her whispers and apparent conversation, not intended for other people.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">Immediately Mary Slessor set them straight.
    &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;I know what I am doing. I'm talking to Jesus.&quot;
    She explained that in everything she prayed and vented her feelings to the Lord. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">There's a good chance that your employer might
    wonder if both of your oars reach the water, if you prayed audibly all of the time; but
    you can make it a practice, as did David Moore's mother, never to say, &quot;Amen,&quot;
    never, in reality, to say, &quot;OK, God, that's it for now. I'll be in touch with you the
    next time I have a need.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">Prayer is conversation between you and your
    Heavenly Father. It's a dialogue that should never end. Though you may never have noticed
    this fact in the Gospel, it's interesting to observe that the prayers of Jesus were very
    short in public, very long in private. His conversation with His Heavenly Father ended
    only when He cried, &quot;Into thy hands I commend my Spirit,&quot; and then God glorified
    Him as His Son and received Him into His presence.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">May God forgive us for the Amens we have used to
    conclude our praying, and keep the dialogue going. Yes, indeed.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Pray without ceasing,&quot; (1 Thessalonians
    5:17, KJV).</font></p>
