                  <p><em><strong>by: Dieudieu Soliva</strong></em></p>
                  <p> <em><strong><img src="../../vol5/no3/images/chocohills.jpg" width="300" height="169" align="right"></strong></em>After 
                    celebrating the much awaited and publicized wedding of our 
                    very own Glen Bertulfo and his bride Janita Yulo - where we 
                    were part of the entourage -Brian, Joel and I were bound for 
                    Bohol. </p>
                  <p>On our way to Marabut Beach in Samar, it was the couple&#8217;s 
                    treat, Emar - the bride&#8217;s colleague and our good friend, 
                    spontaneously decided to come with us to Bohol. It was a good 
                    thing that she was able to persuade her friend Myra - the 
                    maid of honor, to accompany her. Emar had to postpone her 
                    scheduled trip abroad just to be with us.</p>
                  <p>We first headed to Ormoc City together with the couple and 
                    Glen&#8217;s mom to catch our trip to Cebu City via the Supercat 
                    (nice ride huh). On our way to Cebu, I called my aunt who 
                    was based there to meet me at the pier since it was my very 
                    first time to set foot at her adopted province. When we arrived 
                    at the pier, the trip to Tagbilaran City was just about to 
                    leave. This left us with no other choice but to depart immediately. 
                    We were not given a chance to even take a peek at what Cebu 
                    had to offer. Worse, my aunt had a headache spending her precious 
                    time waiting for me at the pier.</p>
                  <p>When we arrived at the Tagbilaran pier, the rain was still 
                    pouring. This left some of us wondering how we were going 
                    to spend two rainy days on the beach. This really was not 
                    news to us since we already had an inkling about the rainy 
                    weather during our stay in Leyte. After we agreed to rent 
                    a local guide and his van, we had lunch in a cozy restaurant 
                    leaving all the ordering to Brian, who of course is the point 
                    man when it comes to food (yummy).</p>
                  <p>We stayed at the Dumaloan Beach Resort in Panglao Island. 
                    Panglao Island lies just opposite Tagbilaran City, and is 
                    connected to Bohol by two bridges. It consists of two muncipalities, 
                    Dauis in the north and Panglao in the south. The island is 
                    easy to reach and has a number of wonderful white beaches, 
                    which means that on this island, most of Bohol&#8217;s hotels 
                    and resorts can be found.</p>
                  <p>It was raining non-stop all day for two days. The warm water 
                    and white sand, plus the fact that there were only a few people 
                    around, made our stay more exciting. It could have been livelier 
                    if the sun was present. </p>
                  <p>We also visited the Hinagdanan Cave, the Blood Compact site, 
                    the Baclayon Church (oldest church in the country) and the 
                    famous Chocolate Hills. But at that time, the Chocolate Hills 
                    were greener than brown because the grass covering the hills 
                    were still fresh. We didn&#8217;t get to see tarsiers and 
                    the man-made forest because Loboc (the town where these items 
                    can be found) was flooded due to the continuous rain. </p>
                  <p>We also got the chance to visit the house (turned museum) 
                    of ex-President Carlos P. Garcia. Joel got so excited that 
                    he was able to see a tarsier at this place, not alive though 
                    but preserved.</p>
                  <p>Call it luck, divine intervention, or what have you, but 
                    we were able to spend at least a minute basking in the sun 
                    under the Bohol sky. Unfortunately, this was when our plane 
                    was about to take-off. At least, this gave us more reason 
                    to go back to Bohol.</p>
