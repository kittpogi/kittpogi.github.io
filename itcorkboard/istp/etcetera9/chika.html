                    is an annual celebration, but just what is it actually a celebration 
                    of? And how did this peculiar custom originate? Is it, as 
                    some claim, a kind of demon worship? Or is it just a harmless 
                    vestige of some ancient pagan ritual? </font></b></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                    word itself, &quot;Halloween,&quot; actually has its origins 
                    in the Catholic Church. It comes from a contracted corruption 
                    of All Hallows Eve. November 1, &quot;All Hollows Day&quot; 
                    (or &quot;All Saints Day&quot;), is a Catholic day of observance 
                    in honor of saints. But, in the 5th century BC, in Celtic 
                    Ireland, summer officially ended on October 31. The holiday 
                    was called Samhain (sow-en), the Celtic New year. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">One 
                    story says that, on that day, the disembodied spirits of all 
                    those who had died throughout the preceding year would come 
                    back in search of living bodies to possess for the next year. 
                    It was believed to be their only hope for the afterlife. The 
                    Celts believed all laws of space and time were suspended during 
                    this time, allowing the spirit world to intermingle with the 
                    living. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Naturally, 
                    the still-living did not want to be possessed. So on the night 
                    of October 31, villagers would extinguish the fires in their 
                    homes, to make them cold and undesirable. They would then 
                    dress up in all manner of ghoulish costumes and noisily paraded 
                    around the neighborhood, being as destructive as possible 
                    in order to frighten away spirits looking for bodies to possess. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Probably 
                    a better explanation of why the Celts extinguished their fires 
                    was not to discourage spirit possession, but so that all the 
                    Celtic tribes could relight their fires from a common source, 
                    the Druidic fire that was kept burning in the Middle of Ireland, 
                    at Usinach. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Some 
                    accounts tell of how the Celts would burn someone at the stake 
                    who was thought to have already been possessed, as sort of 
                    a lesson to the spirits. Other accounts of Celtic history 
                    debunk these stories as myth. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                    Romans adopted the Celtic practices as their own. But in the 
                    first century AD, they abandoned any practice of sacrificing 
                    of humans in favor of burning effigies. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                    thrust of the practices also changed over time to become more 
                    ritualized. As belief in spirit possession waned, the practice 
                    of dressing up like hobgoblins, ghosts, and witches took on 
                    a more ceremonial role. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                    custom of Halloween was brought to America in the 1840's by 
                    Irish immigrants fleeing their country's potato famine. At 
                    that time, the favorite pranks in New England included tipping 
                    over outhouses and unhinging fence gates. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                    custom of trick-or-treating is thought to have originated 
                    not with the Irish Celts, but with a ninth-century European 
                    custom called souling. On November 2, All Souls Day, early 
                    Christians would walk from village to village begging for 
                    &quot;soul cakes,&quot; made out of square pieces of bread 
                    with currants. The more soul cakes the beggars would receive, 
                    the more prayers they would promise to say on behalf of the 
                    dead relatives of the donors. At the time, it was believed 
                    that the dead remained in limbo for a time after death, and 
                    that prayer, even by strangers, could expedite a soul's passage 
                    to heaven. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
                    The Jack-o-lantern custom probably comes from Irish folklore. 
                    As the tale is told, a man named Jack, who was notorious as 
                    a drunkard and trickster, tricked Satan into climbing a tree. 
                    Jack then carved an image of a cross in the tree's trunk, 
                    trapping the devil up the tree. Jack made a deal with the 
                    devil that, if he would never tempt him again, he would promise 
                    to let him down the tree. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">According 
                    to the folk tale, after Jack died, he was denied entrance 
                    to Heaven because of his evil ways, but he was also denied 
                    access to Hell because he had tricked the devil. Instead, 
                    the devil gave him a single ember to light his way through 
                    the frigid darkness. The ember was placed inside a hollowed-out 
                    turnip to keep it glowing longer. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                    Irish used turnips as their &quot;Jack's lanterns&quot; originally. 
                    But when the immigrants came to America, they found that pumpkins 
                    were far more plentiful than turnips. So the Jack-O-Lantern 
                    in America was a hollowed-out pumpkin, lit with an ember. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
                    So, although some pagan groups, cults, and Satanists may have 
                    adopted Halloween as their favorite &quot;holiday,&quot; the 
                    day itself did not grow out of evil practices. It grew out 
                    of the rituals of Celts celebrating a new year, and out of 
                    Medieval prayer rituals of Europeans. And today, even many 
                    churches have Halloween parties or pumpkin carving events 
                    for the kids. After all, the day itself is only as evil as 
                    one cares to make it. </font></p>
