      cars starting in the driveway and if he didn't want to remain there by
      himself, he'd better let his friends know that he needed a ride home.
      Shining the light on the walls one more time sent chills down his spine
      and he, my brave hero, cleared the stairs and front door in record time.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">The word about our old
      house being haunted seemed to spread like wildfire, and several of the
      boys decided to check into the records. Unknown to us when we bought the
      house, a young girl had been murdered there and her body had been left
      between our and the neighbor's yard. She had been brutally stabbed and her
      case had never been solved. Was she the one crying in our hallway?</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">My hubby went armed with
      a camera to check out Brian's story about the bathroom and after taking
      several pictures as proof, bolted the front door to keep everyone out.
      This unfortunately didn't hamper my older son who after relating the story
      to his friends, decided to visit and see it for himself.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">John and four of his big,
      brave friends, went armed with a couple of baseball bats and flashlights
      that evening. Since they couldn't enter from the front, they pushed in the
      back door where we had a small refrigerator blocking the way. They managed
      to make enough room to squeeze in and headed to the second floor. John's
      friend Steve was the first to hear what sounded like something being
      dropped on one of the upper floors. These guys had their trusty weapons
      and felt confident that they could take care of anything. Maybe someone
      had entered through a window and they would be the ones to catch him.
      There it was again, this time it sounded like something being dragged
      across the floor!</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">With my son in the lead
      the intrepid five climbed to the third floor and and almost fell down the
      stairs backwards when they heard it again from my hubby's den. Two of the
      five decided to wait on the lower floor and quickly headed down in that
      direction. Unfortunately they took two of the three flashlights with them
      and the one my son had was already growing dim. There it was again! That
      same dragging sound and it was much louder now. John shined his fading
      light toward the dark abyss of the den and in the black of the room, an
      even darker shape passed the doorway.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">The three frantically
      tried pulling the bolted front door off it's hinges and when they realized
      it wasn't going to work, pushed past the two standing in the hall and
      tried to fit three bodies through that narrow opening beside the
      refrigerator.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">On the last load of boxes
      my hubby was bringing from that house, his truck exploded and everything
      it, but the passengers, burned to the ground. We never went back and now a
      new family is moving in there. I wonder if they'll be welcomed.</font></center>
