      <p align="center"><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">I was
      never a believer in the supernatural. I never gave it much thought since I
      myself had never experienced anything that could be described as even
      remotely supernatural. When I heard people talk about something that
      either they themselves or a friend or relative had experienced, I always
      scoffed at their stories. Now I perk up my ears and listen to every word,
      because I am still trying to convince myself that I wasn't
      hallucinating,the night I saw a ghostly bride.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
      I had only visited my Aunt Helens a few times, so I wasn't really familiar
      with the roads that ran across town. I remember thinking how well
      maintained the City kept their roads. Traveling these roads were a
      pleasure. I was use to roads speckled on both sides with various size pot
      holes. I was looking forward to a family gathering. We were sure to have a
      good time, and I wasn't disappointed.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
      I had left Aunt Helens quite late that evening. The night was brisk and
      very clear. It would be a nice drive back to the city. When I got into the
      car I wasn't sure if the turnpike was North or South of the quite suburban
      street. I looked around to try and get my bearings, when I spotted the
      lights that I assumed came from the large fuel tanks that were on both
      sides of the entrance to town. They were like beacons, pointing the way.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
      Well I can't go wrong if I just keep the lights in my view, so that was
      the direction I would head. I was driving for what seemed only a few
      minutes, when I found myself on a dirt road. I must have turned off the
      main road, but couldn't see how that was possible. I was a State Policeman
      at the time and was on the road constantly, how could I have just driven
      off the main highway within a matter of what seemed like minutes.
      &quot;Nothing to do but keep going.&quot; I told myself. The road was dirt
      and narrow. As if a veil had fallen over the road, the fog was coming in
      so fast I had to slow down to the lowest mileage without stalling out. The
      visibility was only about fifty feet. I could smell the marsh that ran
      along the side of the road. That seemed to be where this fog was rolling
      in from. I could barely make out the sides of the road. There seemed to be
      ditches on both sides. Well If I just keep moving along it's bound to
      bring me back to a paved road, I kept telling myself. Just up ahead I
      could make out a small one lane wooden bridge. As I got closer I could
      hear the ripple of the creek that ran underneath. As I started across my
      eyes blinked in disbelief. Standing on the side of the road a few feet
      from the bridge, stood a woman dressed in a BRIDAL GOWN AND VAIL. I
      started to roll down the window as I approached this poor unlucky bride.
      &quot;They must have broken down, and her husband went in the other
      direction to find help&quot; I reasoned with myself. Rolling to a stop
      directly in front of her, I leaned out to ask if I could be of any
      assistance. The fog was thick around her, yet a breeze played around her
      vail. The vail blew away for an instant, and I was looking into an
      ...EMPTY VAIL....No face, just a vale blown aside and surrounding
      emptiness. The hairs bristled on both my neck and arms, as I hurriedly
      started to roll the window back up, the much too warm fog started to seep
      into the car. I stepped on the gas and in the blink of an eye I was on a
      paved main highway. THIS was something I will have to think and re-think a
      dozen times in my mind. Hopefully tomorrow's light will put this whole
      experience into a rational explanation.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
      Though it meant a couple hours drive going back to Aunt Helens; I decided
      it was worth the trip back to try and find the DIRT ROAD. With all the fog
      that was surrounding the area it was quite possible for me to have missed
      seeing the turnoff, where I must have turned. I also wanted to see the
      marshes in the sunlight.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
      I arrived back into the small town early in the morning. I drove over the
      same route that I had traveled over the night before. Back and forth, up
      one street and down another and still NO DIRT ROAD. Aunt Helen said she
      would have been surprised if I had found one, as to her knowledge there
      are no dirt roads any where in that area. My experience happened in the
      early fifties. I never really sorted it out in my mind. Years later
      reading a supermarket tabloid, I read of an identical incident which
      happened to another lone driver on a lonely dirt road. It was nowhere near
      the dirt road I was on. WAS SHE SEARCHING FOR THE WAY HOME?</font><font color="white" size="+0"><br>
