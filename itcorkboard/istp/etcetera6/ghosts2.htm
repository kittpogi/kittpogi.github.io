      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">This questions is often
      asked by the budding ghost hunter, the curious and the concerned.&nbsp;
      Where are ghosts?&nbsp; How do we locate them?&nbsp; Are there any near
      me?&nbsp;&nbsp; First I'll cover some the basic theories concerning the
      living and the dead interacting.&nbsp; I believe that all people have the
      ability to see/sense ghosts.&nbsp; Some of us are born sensitive, always
      seeing/sensing them. Some are sensitive in certain locations like their
      home or other place they are relaxed.&nbsp; Others are just in tune at the
      right time and show sensitivity briefly.&nbsp; Having said that, I'll tell
      you now that spirits can be anywhere.&nbsp; There isn't any place that you
      will not find them, but the point of this article is to help you find them
      so there are places that are more likely to have strong spirit activity.&nbsp;
      In location of strong spirit activity, it is possible for the less
      sensitive to slowly learn how to tune in.&nbsp; These are also the places
      where ghost investigators or hunters will look since the odds are better
      that they will locate a ghost or two.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><b><img border="0" src="../../vol2/no2/images/9ripcross.gif" align="right" width="68" height="117">Cemeteries</b> - The
      age of the cemetery doesn't matter but the older it is, the more time it
      has had to accumulate restless spirits.&nbsp; Why cemeteries?&nbsp; Well
      there are theories such as they are portals to the other side or that some
      spirits are drawn to their former bodies.&nbsp; Why did we pick that spot
      to build a cemetery?&nbsp; American Indians looked for sacred ground to
      bury the dead.&nbsp; Were the people who picked a location for a cemetery
      drawn to a spot by other forces?&nbsp; There may be more at play here in
      the cemetery than meets the eye.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Schools </b>- Schools
      and former sites of schools may have the build up of psychic energies and&nbsp;
      imprints of all the highly emotional events that have transpired there.&nbsp;
      All the energy, hormones, etc. create a place where there is a surplus of
      super charged energy.&nbsp; This always seems to attract spirits.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Theaters</b> - The
      actors have run the gambit of human emotions inside the walls of a theater
      plus&nbsp; many have interesting hauntings attached to them.&nbsp; Many
      old theaters have interesting histories that may contribute to the
      likelihood that there are spirits there.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Battlefields</b> -
      These are great locations simply because of their nature.&nbsp; Many
      violent deaths in one area will always hold some spirits and psychic
      energy there.&nbsp; A soldiers life and death struggle exudes a large
      amount of energy.&nbsp; this is also a great spot for residual hauntings.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Churches</b> - There
      is a long history of the faithful returning to the church they worshipped
      at.&nbsp; They may be looking for the salvation they were promised and
      cannot find.&nbsp; Churches also have large amounts of human emotional
      energy trapped there left behind from weddings, funerals, etc.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Hotels/Motels/Boarding
      houses</b> - Many dark dealing and highly emotional events take places in
      these rooms.&nbsp; They also have a lot of traffic, many people are in and
      out of these rooms.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Historic Locations</b>
      - Many historic buildings, because of their age, have had more time to
      have spirits attach to it.&nbsp; These buildings are often open the public
      and can give you a easy place to start.&nbsp; Many even have known
      histories of hauntings and you may be able to gain access to the building
      after hours after speaking with the caretakers.</font></p>
