      <p><center><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">I'm sure many of
      you have had strange things happen to you through your life, well so have
      I. It might be because I am pure Celtic blood or just plain unlucky, I
      don't know. So take your pick I don't care, just listen to what I have to
      say then judge. &nbsp;</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp; My first
      experience was when I was three years old. The details are fuzzy but the
      fear isn't. I remember my Mother was outside talking to a neighbor and I
      was in the living room by myself playing. A terrible feeling of dread came
      over me as I sat there and then I started to hear the sound of marching
      troops coming down the street.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">The closer they got, the
      more afraid I became. I started to shake, the hair on my arms and neck
      stood up and I started to cry. I knew I had to hide so I crawled under the
      desk. There I curled up into a ball and as the marching got so loud and
      the fear so intense, I started to scream and scream until my Mother came
      in. I tried to tell her what was wrong, but how does a three year old
      explain something like that?</font>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">Needless to say there
      were no marching troops outside, so what was it that frightened me? Was it
      a memory of a life that was ended during a war long past?</center><br>

      <br>
      <center>Up until the age of five we lived in the same big old house with
      my father's parents and my Uncle Lee. The house was so big that they lived
      in one half and we in the other. I loved my Grandmother and spent all my
      time with her. The day came when we moved to a house of our own, much to
      my dismay, but being young I soon got over it.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">Years passed and soon I
      was thirteen. My Grandmother had Parkinson Disease and she lost her
      balance on the steps, fell and broke her hip. While in the hospital she
      got pneumonia. They had her in an oxygen tent and then she had a stroke
      and died. I was totally heartbroken.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">I remember we were to go
      up to the house the next day and clean for the wake after the funeral.
      That night I had a dream that I was to go upstairs and clean the bathroom.
      I opened the doors from the living room to the main hall and started up
      the stairs, when I looked up there stood my Grandmother with her arms
      reaching out to me, beckoning me to come to her.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">She had on a long blue
      dress with white lace around the neck and sleeves. I knew she was dead and
      if I went to her I would also die. I awoke with a scream, my heart
      pounding madly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">The next day we went to
      the funeral home for the first time to see her. I didn't want to see her
      but my Mother insisted that I go and pay my last respects. Slowly I made
      my way up to the casket, not wanting to see someone that I loved laying
      there dead, and as I slowly looked down at her I almost passed out.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">There she laid, in the
      exact same dress that I saw in my dream. Did she come for me and would I
      have died if I went to her?</center><br>
