      <p><center><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">We moved into our
      new home two days after our daugher's 16th birthday. We now had five
      children, the youngest was just nine months old. I fell in love with this
      beautiful Colonial house the minute I saw it. With it's high ceilings and
      large rooms, it reminded me of our house in England.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">The strangest thing
      happened the first night we moved in, we all had the same dream. I can
      remember comparing our dreams over breakfast the next morning. We all
      dreamed that we were walking on the third floor when we came upon a room
      between the bathroom and the last room at the end of the hall. In this
      room was an old man with gray hair sitting in a chair. When he noticed us,
      he motioned for us to follow him. He led us to a fireplace where he stuck
      his hand inside and pulled out a box. As he opened it, we caught a glint
      of jewels shining from the light above hitting the surfaces.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">The only problem with
      that dream was, there was no room between the bathroom and the last
      bedroom. We had two fireplaces in this house and we checked both of them
      just in case there was any merit to our dreams. As far as we could tell,
      nothing was in those fireplaces but a bunch of soot and ashes.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">Our youngest son told us
      many times about the old man who was living in this house, but we thought
      he just had an active imagination.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">This house had a history,
      it was the first mayor's house and was used as a speak-easy in the 20's.
      There was even an alarm switch in the living room to alert everyone in
      case of a raid. When we explored the basement, we discovered a wine cellar
      on one side and a half stone, half boarded room on the other, filled with
      sand.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">We weren't going to take
      any chances with this home...Two weeks after moving in we had our Priest
      over for dinner and he blessed every inch of our house. He even blessed
      the room in the basement filled with sand.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">It was about a year after
      moving in, on the anniversary of my father-in-law's death, when we heard
      the footsteps. Our kids were sleeping and my hubby and I were in our
      bedroom talking when we heard someone walk up the stairs and stop in the
      hallway outside of our door. We went to check who was walking around so
      late at night and found the kids sleeping and no one else in the house. My
      hubby just laughed and said it was probably his dad coming for a visit.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">We would hear so many
      unexplained things, that my hubby started keeping a diary of the date and
      time of each occurrence.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">The most memorable was
      when my youngest son was in the kitchen with his father. Brian was
      standing near the stove behind his father watching him cook his famous
      stew, when he noticed something moving near the doorway. As he turned his
      head, a man with grey hair and an old sweater with patches on the elbow,
      slowly walked in the door and headed toward him. Brian started pulling on
      his father's shirt to get his attention as the man continued in his
      direction. He tried to call out to warn his father but in his fear could
      only make noises that sounded like a squeak. By the time the ghost walked
      through the table, my son was pounding his father on his back making some
      sort of wheezing sound and shaking like a leaf. My hubby naturally turned
      in the wrong direction and missed the whole thing, but when he looked at
      Brian, he knew something had happened. Brian was chalk white, trembling
      with tears running down his face.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
      Whoever this man was, he didn't stay confined to one area. We would hear
      the front door open while we were having dinner, and footsteps down the
      hall toward the kitchen. Everyone would be watching the dooway to see who
      it was, and when no one would enter we would go to investigate. He would
      also walk up the stairs to the third floor and stand outside of my hubby's
      den. In the beginning, my hubby would race across the floor and throw open
      the door to catch whoever was there. After so many years of tripping over
      his own feet to find an empty hallway, he just ignored it.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">My hubby loves to edit
      his own films and make movies out of his hunting trips. One evening while
      he was in his den playing with his films, he noticed two red lights on the
      wall above his radio. He thought they were being reflected from something
      in the room and curious to find the source, searched the room. It wasn't
      coming from the small wing-shaped window on the side of the room or the TV
      or VCR. He stood between the lights and everything that could have caused
      them with no success. He then called me up there to see if I could figure
      it out. We turned off everything that could be making the light and
      noticed these two red things on the wall glowing even brighter. When we
      turned off the lamp and the lights were still there, I went running back
      to my room. They were gone by the next day and we never discovered what
      they were, but from that time on, he had the responsibility of cleaning
      the den. I refused to go in that room again.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">My daughters and I had
      been out shopping and returned one evening to an empty house. As we
      entered the front door, we heard a strange noise coming from somewhere on
      the upper floor. I thought one of the girls had left her radio or TV on
      but didn't remember hearing anything when we left the house earlier.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">As we started up the
      stairs the noise became somewhat louder and sounded more like chanting
      than music. When we reached the second floor, we discovered the sound
      seemed to be coming from the floor above and since the girls' bedrooms
      were all on the second floor, I realized that it couldn't be the TV, we
      didn't have one up there at that time. My daughter Dawn grabbed my arm to
      stop me from ascending the stairs leading to the third floor, but I
      continued climbing. If someone was in my house, I wanted to know who they
      were and what they were doing.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" size="2" face="Verdana">By the time we were
      halfway up those steps we realized the noise sounded like some sort of
      ceremony, almost like the devil worship movies I'd seen on television.
      When we reached the door to my hubby's den, the chanting stopped. The
      sound had been coming from the den, the same room where the footsteps
      always stopped.</font></center></p>
