      <p><center><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">It all started
      while I was living in New Port R.I. A place rich in history and beautiful
      mansions and darn it I didn't get to live in one. I did however live in an
      old victorian house that was quite large and converted into two
      apartments. Our's was downstairs with an entrance way that ran the whole
      length of the house. As you came in the front door, off to your right were
      pocket doors to the living room. Usually they were left open except for
      when I was in there sleeping, because that is where I slept on a daybed.
      The front of the house had a large front window with large thick wooden
      shutters which were used during north easterners or hurricanes. My day bed
      was right under the window. I liked it because I could open the window,
      look at the stars, and hear the ocean.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">To give you a better
      layout of the room, the pocket doors were to the left, a large fireplace
      to the right and another set of pocket doors facing north to the
      diningroom. It was rather a large room and quite comfortable.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">Two days before, a Friday
      night to be exact, we had gone to the wharf to get fresh seafood to eat
      and look around because I had never seen one before. There were all kinds
      of fish, clams and a lot of poor lobsters. I felt so bad for them. I'm
      sure you are wondering why, right? Well back then they would drive wooden
      pegs into their claws so they couldn't grab you. That was so cruel, or so
      I thought, so I went around and took all the pegs out. There was this one
      lobster who had to have weighed at least twenty pounds. He or she was
      about three feet long with claws so big that I swear they could cut your
      arm off if it got a hold of you. I wanted to buy it but my boyfriend
      wouldn't pay thirty dollars for it and then I wanted to sneek it outside
      and drop it into the ocean but the old party poop said no, I would go to
      jail if I got caught. Darn, well I tried.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">We got our food and took
      it outside to the tables they had to eat it, then went home. Later I
      started to get terrible stomach pains and started to throw up. I was so
      sick I thought I was going to die and then I was hopping I would. The next
      day all I did was stay in bed, sick as a dog.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">Sunday morning rolled
      around and I slept late. When I did wake up I just laid there with my eyes
      shut enjoying the feeling of not being sick anymore. I heard the doors
      open, thinking it was my boyfriend coming to check on me and just laid
      there pretending to be asleep. I heard no movement, it was so quiet, then
      I got this terrible feeling something was not right. It became so very
      cold and the air was hard to breath. I was absolutely frozen with fear.
      Then I felt it....some 'thing' sat on my bed and then laid down beside me.
      As it put it's arm around me I could feel this terrible cold through the
      covers and on the back of my neck. I wanted to scream but I couldn't, I
      couldn't move. My mind was screaming for help but my mouth wouldn't move.
      Then the front door opened and my boyfriend and his parents came in. It
      vanished, just like that, gone. What a relief! I'm not ashamed to say that
      after that, it wasn't long before I left for home.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">I don't know what or who
      it was and don't care. I'll let you be the judge.</center><br>

      <center>This last story is one that is from the most difficult period of
      my life, one I have trouble talking about. So please bear with me on this.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">The parts I'm going to
      tell you about all started on oct.28, 1981. It was in the middle of the
      afternoon while I was sitting in the living room watching tv when
      everything around me faded away and I heard a loud humming my ears. Before
      my eyes I could see a car accident and had a strong feeling of death. It
      only lasted a few moments but it was long enough to leave me shaking with
      dread. I've had premonitions before but never of this magnitude. I could
      only surmise that it had to do with my youngest son Chris because he
      walked to school and had to cross a busy street.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">The next morning I walked
      him to school and as we were about to cross the street a car pulled out of
      a side street and was broadsided by a van. The car was shoved in our
      direction and almost hit us, but we jumped out of it's way in time. My
      premonition was right, I saved Chris.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">Later that day my oldest
      son Richie came home from school and I told him that a friend had been
      calling him and that he wanted him to return his call. He did, and then
      said he was going over there for a little while but would be home soon.
      That was the last time I saw him alive.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">The next night I was
      laying in bed not able to sleep and I looked at the clock , it said three
      a.m. when I heard someone or something come up on the porch. I absolutely
      froze. You've heard the expression ice in your vains? Well that's what it
      felt like. Whatever was there knocked on the door three times.
      Knock......knock.....knock, I knew that what was there was not human but I
      didn't know what it wanted except that it wasn't good. Then I heard it
      leave. Thank God!</font>
      <p><font color="#FFAC59" face="Verdana" size="2">Later I was told by
      someone that I had cheated death and it had come to get who it was suppose
      to. If that were true than why did my other son die? Was he a replacement?
      You be the judge.</font></p>
