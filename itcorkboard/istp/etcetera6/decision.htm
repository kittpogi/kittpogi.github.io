      purpose&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <ol style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt">
        <li><font SIZE="2" face="Verdana"><b>Life is a spiral.</b><br>
          People today are intimidated by how much choice they have. There are
          almost too many career choices, too many life choices. People are
          overwhelmed at times by the decisions they get to make-and have to
          make-about their jobs, their families, their businesses, their
          futures. There are so many variables today: Where will you work? Where
          will you live? What do you want for yourself? What do you want for
          your family? If you don't have a way to sort it all out, you can
          become paralyzed.<br>
          <br>
          I have a visual exercise that helps you understand the choices you
          have to make at different points in your life. Draw a little spiral,
          something like a tornado going upwards. That spiral represents the</font>
          <font SIZE="2" face="Verdana">different phases you encounter in your
          life. There are times in life when you're on a plateau, where things
          are well balanced. Then along comes a triggering event that knocks you
          into limbo. When that trigger occurs, you have to put all your energy
          into handling the situation, whether it's an emergency at work, the
          death of a close friend, or your own health crisis.<br>
          <br>
          That puts you into the third part of the spiral: a period of
          uncertainty. Something is ending, something else is about to begin-but
          you're between the ending and the beginning. To get out of limbo, you
          have to look at everything you've been carrying with you. You have to
          unpack your bag and then repack it, so you can go on to the next phase
          of your life.<br>
          <br>
          Today more and more people are being struck by more and more triggers.
          One out of two marriages ends in divorce. Every eight seconds, one of
          the country's 76 million Baby Boomers turns 50. In the workplace,
          companies have downsized and reengineered, and people have become free
          agents. As a consequence, more people are asking themselves where
          they're going, what they're going to do with the rest of their lives,
          and what really matters to them. These aren't decisions you can just
          think your way through. They involve emotions more than ideas-how we
          feel about ourselves, more than how we think about ourselves.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Answer these two questions.&nbsp;</b><br>
          Ask yourself these questions and answer them honestly: What do you
          want? And how will you know when you get it? People really do have
          their own solutions. The problem is, either they don't know how to
          discover them, or they avoid discovering them. But if you want to come
          up with good decisions for your work and your life, simply ask those
          two questions-because it all comes down to very simple things.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Feed these three hungers.&nbsp;</b><br>
          There are three hungers that people are trying to feed throughout
          their lives. The first is to connect deeply with the creative spirit
          of life. Sooner or later, most people come to recognize that there is
          some sort of creative energy that infuses all of life. They feel a
          hunger to touch that energy and to be touched by it. That doesn't mean
          that you have to be a creative person in a classic sense-to make your
          living as a painter, a dancer, a writer, or an actor. It could mean an
          experience as universal as bringing a child into the world, or helping
          to nurture and shape a life. It could mean finding ways to infuse the
          workplace with more creativity and more playfulness.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          The second hunger is to know and express your gifts and talents. The
          people I have met in my 30 years as a career counselor are always
          absolutely sure that they have some unique talent. They may not know
          what it is yet. They may not know how to express it. It may have
          nothing to do with how they earn a living or what they do at work. But
          they know that they have something within them that they have to
          contribute. And this feeling lasts throughout your lifetime: The
          healthiest seniors I've met continue to explore their gifts and
          abilities, long after they've left the workplace.<br>
          <br>
          The third hunger is to know that our lives matter. Everyone wants to
          leave behind some kind of legacy, some kind of personal mark. It
          doesn't have to be great or magnificent. But human beings know that at
          one level, we each have a own unique thumbprint, and we all want to
          leave that print behind for others to see that we've been here. We can
          be successful, make a lot of money, reach a certain status, but it
          will be success without fulfillment. Fulfillment comes from feeding
          these three hungers.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Discover the four factors of every
          decision.&nbsp;</b><br>
          No matter what decision you're facing, the same four elements apply.
          First, discover how to live from the inside out. You absolutely have
          to start with yourself, not with the external demands of the
          situation. Second, discover your gifts. What is it that makes you
          unique? What song do you want to sing? Third, discover what moves
          you.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Where do you find joy? A decision that connects with your own emotions
          is much more likely to succeed. And fourth, discover solitude. Go to a
          special place where you can find quiet. If it's the mountains, take
          the time to get there. If you can't go there, create a space in which
          you can find a similar peace of mind. In solitude, you're much more
          likely to deal with the first three elements of this process.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Answer the ultimate question.</b><br>
          The ultimate question is, What is your vision of the good life? In
          this culture, there's a tendency to talk about the good life in</font>
          <font size="2" face="Verdana">consumerist terms. It's all external. We
          measure the good life by the car we drive, the Scotch we drink, the
          designer brand we wear, the community we live in. In doing research
          for my books I ask people for their definition of the good life.
          Remarkably, I hear the same answer: The good life means living in the
          place where you belong, being with the people you love, doing the
          right work-on purpose.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          You can boil it down to those four elements. You live in a place where
          you feel you belong. You're with people you love, and your
          relationships are working-including your relationship with yourself.
          You've got the right work: You're using your talents on something you
          believe in, in an environment that fits who you are. And you're doing
          it all on purpose: It fits your overall philosophy.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          With all of those elements, you look at your life and work from the
          inside out. They're all about you as an individual, about creating
          meaning for yourself, rather than having the outside world create it
          for you.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Make every job search an in-venture
          and an adventure.</b><br>
          Looking for a job is so much a part of everyone's experience, and is
          so important to each of us, that not only is it worth talking about on
          its own terms, but it also relates to the much larger issue of
          personal direction. Start with a fairly simple fact: If you don't know
          what you're looking for, almost any job will look great. And if you
          don't know where you're going, a lot of paths will take you there. But
          if you do care where you work and where you're going, how do you
          assess what's right for you?&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          We all need good information to make good decisions. There are two
          parts to good information gathering. The first is internal-I call it
          &quot;in-venturing.&quot; It means taking a long look inside yourself.
          For some people-particularly tough-minded, old-school
          businesspeople-that can be very difficult. This personal reflection
          stuff is not their cup of&nbsp;</font> <font size="2" face="Verdana">tea.
          They're not interested in it, and they're not comfortable with</font> <font size="2" face="Verdana">it.
          For others, it's not only part of who they are-they've built time for
          it into their life. By participating in programs such as Outward
          Bound, they try to live a more conscious, reflective life. Whether
          you're comfortable with it or not, to make a good life decision, you
          have to answer some hard questions about who you are and what you
          want. I believe we all have answers to those questions- we all have
          mental maps that express our innermost sense of ourselves.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          In-venturing gives us the quiet and the time to discover those
          maps.&nbsp; Then, after you know more about your map, you're ready for
          the second part of good information gathering: adventuring.
          Adventuring takes you out into the world, prepares you to find the
          people and environments that fit your needs, suit your talents, and
          match your map. Of course, in reality, you don't first do in-venturing
          and then do adventuring; they happen simultaneously. But frequently,
          in-venturing doesn't happen at all-people simply avoid it. An event
          will trigger a change, but instead of taking time for reflection, they
          go back out into the world. And what they find is the same kind of
          job, the same kind of situation that didn't work for them before.<br>
          <br>
          You see the same pattern in both work and marriage: You leave a job
          that makes you unhappy-and then find the same kind of job. You get
          divorced-and then marry the same kind of person. And typically, you
          blame the world for these bad experiences, rather than doing
          self-reflection or finding some coaching to break the pattern.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Use this formula for a good career
          decision.&nbsp;</b><br>
          Over the years, I've devised a very simple formula that lays out the
          critical factors to consider when you're making a career choice:&nbsp;<br>
          T + P + E x V.<br>
          <br>
          T stands for talent, and it's where you should begin when you're
          considering a career choice or a career change. Very simply, the
          questions are, What are your strengths and weaknesses? How can you
          focus on your strengths and manage your weaknesses? Most people aren't
          using their talents. They didn't choose their career; their career
          chose them. They got into a line of work because they had to get a
          job, or somebody told them they'd be good at a job.</font>&nbsp; <font size="2" face="Verdana">They
          were young, they started down a certain path, and they never stopped
          to ask what their calling might be-not just their job, but their real
          calling. Then before they know it, they hit midlife, and they're
          asking themselves, &quot;Why am I doing this? Why did I start down
          this path instead of following my real talents?&quot;.<br>
          <br>
          P stands for passion, or for purpose. Talents develop best in the
          context of interest. Aristotle said it a long time ago: &quot;Where
          the needs of the world and your talents cross, there lies your
          vocation.&quot; Ask yourself, &quot;What needs doing in your
          organization? What needs doing in the world?&quot; Then put your
          talents to work on some area of need that you believe in. Choosing
          your work is your chance to do something more meaningful than getting
          up in the morning, putting in your time, doing what it takes to pay
          the bills.<br>
          <br>
          The E stands for environment: What work environment best suits your
          style, your temperament, your values? I often meet people who have
          identified their talents and their passion, but who are working in an
          environment that doesn't permit them to express themselves. When they
          move to a new environment, one that uses their talents and honors
          their values, they suddenly find an alignment that works. They
          discover new energy and new purpose in their work.<br>
          <br>
          V stands for vision-how you see the rest of your life. Talent,
          purpose, and environment are all about work style and work choice.
          Vision describes how work fits into the rest of your life. Where do
          you want to live? How much money is enough? How important are your
          relationships? What are you doing to stay healthy?<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Live in the real world.<br>
          </b>In an ideal world, you would do what you love, and you would get
          paid handsomely for it. But in the real world, you're often pulled in
          two or more different directions. It's become popular to say,
          &quot;Just follow your bliss and the money will come.&quot; I don't
          believe that at all.<br>
          <br>
          These decisions take hard work. You can't simplify life into that kind
          of wishful thinking. But what does work is something called natural
          productivity. It happens when the elements of that formula -T + P + E
          x V- are in alignment: You do your best when you're using your talents
          on something you believe in, and when your environment supports your
          effort. The number-one factor that holds people back is their
          environment. People have real talents that they're prepared to apply
          to something they believe in, but their environment is toxic. They
          take their talents and sense of purpose to a job across the street-and
          they shine.<br>
          <br>
          Most people who feel a tension between what they say they want to do
          and what they find themselves doing simply haven't done their
          homework. They're waiting for someone else to make the choice for
          them-or for the world to present them with a corner office, a lot of
          money, and a life of travel.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Don't sell yourself short.</b><br>
          Work can and should give you a sense of joy. You spend 60% of your
          life doing work or getting ready for it. So to dismiss your work by
          saying, &quot;I'm just doing this to pay the bills&quot; seems like an
          enormous trade-off. Are you really willing to trade off 60% of your
          time just to have money to spend in the time that's left? That's not a
          good investment. And if money is what motivates you, ask yourself
          this: What if you could invest in yourself? Would you invest more if
          you knew you were working on something that used your talents and
          tapped your passion? If you could invest in yourself, why not invest
          in your time?<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Find motivation from without-and
          from within.&nbsp;<br>
          </b>I'm not naive about motivation. External rewards like money play
          an important role in motivating people. But so does getting
          recognition for mastery. I know a lot of people who have made a lot of
          money, and what they want now is the recognition that comes from being
          at the top of their profession. Another motivator is a chance to work
          with a team that you value in a place where you feel valued. You love
          going to work because of the people you're working with. Together you
          have a chance to create something that really matters. On an internal
          level, recognizing your talents can be a great motivator: What you
          want more than anything else is the opportunity to express yourself.
          For purposes of self-motivation, nothing is more powerful than the
          desire to demonstrate your talents.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Get advice from within-and from
          without.<br>
          </b>I start with one simple truth: All change is internal change.
          Ultimately, every decision comes from within you-and you can't
          separate yourself into a work &quot;you&quot; and a life
          &quot;you.&quot; Every decision touches all of you.<br>
          <br>
          That said, it's just as critical to have other people you can turn to
          for advice and perspective-a personal board of directors. You need a
          variety of people, each with a different outlook. As you go down the
          boardroom table, you see your family; you see someone who's been a
          mentor to you. I recommend at least one or two people who are
          &quot;go-to&quot; people-regular sounding boards. You need at least
          one person you see all the time, someone who's a great listener and
          who allows you to make your decision. You're not asking that person to
          make the decision. You're asking them to listen and to help you with
          your decision process. You may even have someone on your board who's
          no longer alive-but whose opinion you value and with whom you can have
          a virtual conversation about the decision you're facing.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Make your decisions the way senior
          citizens wish they had.<br>
          </b>For nearly 25 years, I've been doing interviews with senior
          citizens, asking them to look back over their lives and talk about
          what they've learned. I've conducted more than 1,000 interviews with
          people who were successful in their jobs, who retired from leading
          companies after distinguished careers. Almost without exception, when
          these older people look back, they say the same things-things that are
          instructive and useful for the rest of us as we make decisions going
          forward in our lives. First, they say that if they could live their
          lives over again, they would be more reflective. They got so caught up
          in the doing, they say, that they often lost sight of the meaning.
          Usually it took a crisis for them to look at their lives in
          perspective and try to reestablish the context. Looking back, they
          wish they had stopped at regular intervals to look at the big picture.<br>
          <br>
          They also sounded a warning: Life picks up speed. The first half of
          your life is about getting prepared and getting established. Then time
          shifts gears. You hit the second half of your life, and everything
          moves faster. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, and all of a
          sudden, you're 65 years old. Looking back, they say, you realize that
          time is the most precious currency in life. And as they got older,
          having time for reflection became even more important.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Second, if they could live their lives over again, they would take
          more risks. In relationships, they would have been more courageous.
          And in expressing their creative side, they would have taken more
          chances. I think it was Oliver Wendell Holmes who said, &quot;Most of
          us go to our graves with our music still inside us.&quot; Many of
          these people felt that, despite of their successes, their music was
          still inside them. Almost all of them said that they felt most alive
          when they took risks. Just being busy from business made them numb.
          Aliveness came with learning, growing, stretching, exploring.<br>
          <br>
          Third, if they could live their lives over again, they would
          understand what really gave them fulfillment. I call that the power of
          purpose: doing something that contributes to life, adding value to
          life beyond yourself. Purpose is always outside yourself, beyond your
          ego or your financial self-interest. We all want both success and
          fulfillment. Success is often measured in external ways, but there's
          an internal measure of success, and it's called fulfillment.
          Fulfillment comes from realizing your talents-adding value and living
          by your values. Fulfillment comes from integrity, from being who you
          are and expressing who you are as fully as possible. It doesn't have
          to do with your job description or the specifics of your work. It has
          to do with how you bring your self to your work, regardless of what
          that work is.&nbsp;</font></li>
