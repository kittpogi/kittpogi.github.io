      Scorpios are one of two extremes. One the saint, the other the sinner. The

      drugs. If you are on a blind date, you will know which version </font><font color="#000000">you</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2" color="#000000">
      are dating. Neither type is hung up on what you wear, but more how you
      wear it. Have sex appeal. Be interested in occult matters, be deep. She
      won't offer you much information about herself, you will have to guess.
      Scorpio females will pry your whole life story out of you. To keep her
      interested, be hard to get. You won't know if you are pleasing her, or
      where you stand. A fatal mistake is to anger a Scorpio female. Scorpio
      women will get you! She has a passionate nature and can have more than one
      love interest. They are not usually domestic, nor want to be involved with
      parenthood. She will put all of her intense energy into either partying or

      downright sleazy works for him too. He can make love to you, and not be in
      love with you. His passion can fool women, don't mistake it for love.
      Oftentimes, they are most in love when they can't possess or own you.
      Jealousy is a big issue with him. He stays&nbsp;jealous. He does not care
      what you do for an occupation, nor your financial status. Scorpio males
      want to control you to conform to their ideas of living. So, if you aren't
      strong in your own identity, then </font><font color="#000000">you</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2" color="#000000">
