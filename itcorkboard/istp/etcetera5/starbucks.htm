      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Starbucks is the best example of a phony
      status symbol that means nothing,&nbsp; but people will still pay 10x as much
      for because there are French words all over the place. You want coffee in
      a coffee shop, that's 60 cents. But at Starbucks, Cafe Latte: $3.50. Cafe
      Cremier: $4.50. Cafe Suisse: $9.50. For each French word, another four
      dollars. Why does a little cream in coffee make it worth $3.50? Go into
      any coffee shop; they'll give you all the <img border="0" src="../../vol2/no1/images/starbucks.gif" align="right" alt="Starbucks... say goodbye to your bucks!" width="98" height="99">
       cream you want until you're blue
      in the face. Forty million people are walking around in coffee shops with
      jars of cream: &quot;Here's all the cream you want!&quot; And it's still
      60 cents. You know why? Because it's called &quot;coffee.&quot; If it's
      Cafe Latte - $4.50. You want cinnamon in your coffee? Ask for cinnamon in
      a coffee shop; they'll give you all the cinnamon you want. Do they ask you
      for more money because it's cinnamon? It's the same price for cinnamon in
      your coffee as for coffee without cinnamon - 60 cents, that's it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But not in Starbucks. Over there, it's
      Cinnamonnier $9.50. You want a refill in a regular coffee shop, they'll
      give you all the&nbsp; you want until you drop dead. You can come in when
      you're 27 and keep drinking coffee until you're 98. And they'll start
      begging you: &quot;Here, you want more coffee, you want more, you want
      more?&quot; Do you know that you can't get a refill at Starbucks? A refill
      is a dollar fifty. Two refills, $4.50. Three refills, $19.50. So, for four
      cups of coffee - $350. And it's burnt coffee. It's burnt coffee at
      Starbucks, let's be honest about it. If you get burnt coffee in a coffee
      shop, you call a cop. You say, &quot;It's the bottom of the pot. I don't
      drink from the bottom of the pot.? But when it's burnt at Starbucks, they
      say, &quot;Oh, it's a blend. It's a blend.&quot; It's a special bean from
      Argentina...&quot; The bean is in your head.</p>
      </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And there're no chairs in those
      Starbucks. Instead, they have these high stools. You ever see these
      stools? You haven't been on a chair that high since you were two.
      Seventy-three year old Jews are climbing and climbing to get to the top of
      the chair. And when they get to the top, they can't even drink the coffee
      because there's 12 people around one little table, and everybody's saying,
      &quot;Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me...&quot; Then they can't
      get off the chair. Old Jews are begging Gentiles, &quot;Mister, could you
      get me off this?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do you remember what a cafeteria was? In
      poor neighborhoods all over this country, they went to a cafeteria because
      there were no waiters and no service. And so poor people could save money
      on a tip. Cafeterias didn't have regular tables or chairs either. They
      gave coffee to you in a cardboard cup. So because of that you paid less
      for the coffee. You got less, so you paid less.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's all the same as Starbucks - no
      chairs, no service, a cardboard cup for your coffee - except in Starbucks,
      the less you get, the more it costs. By the time they give you nothing,
      it's worth four times as much. Am I exaggerating? Did you ever try to buy
      a cookie in Starbucks? Buy a cookie in a regular coffee shop. You can tear
      down a building with that cookie. And the whole cookie is 60 cents. At
      Starbucks, you're going to have to hire a detective to find that <img border="0" src="../../vol2/no1/images/starbucks_mug.gif" align="left" width="90" height="90"> cookie,
      and it's $9.50. And you can't put butter on it because they want extra. Do
      you know that if you buy a bagel, you pay extra for cream cheese in
      Starbucks? Cream cheese, another 60 cents. A knife to put it on, 32 cents.
      If it reaches the bagel, 48 cents. That bagel costs you $312. And they
      don't give you the butter or the cream cheese. They don't give it to you.
      They tell you where it is. &quot;Oh, you want butter? It's over there.
      Cream cheese? Over here. Sugar? Sugar is here.&quot; Now you become your
      own waiter. You walk around with a tray. &quot;I'll take the cookie.
      Where's the butter? The butter's here. Where's the cream cheese? The cream
      cheese is there.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You walked around for an hour and a half
      selecting items, and then the guy at the cash register has a glass in
      front of him that says &quot;Tips.&quot; You're waiting on tables for an
      hour, and you owe him money. Then there's a sign that says please clean it
      up when you're finished. They don't give you a waiter or a busboy. Now
      you've become the janitor. Now you have to start cleaning up the place.
      Old Jews are walking around cleaning up Starbucks. &quot;Oh, he's got dirt
      too? Wait, I'll clean this up.&quot; They clean up the place for an hour
      and a half. If I said to you, &quot;I have a great idea for a business.
      I'll open a whole new type of a coffee shop. A whole new type. Instead of
      60 cents for coffee I'll charge $2.50, $3.50, $4.50, and $5.50. Not only
      that, I'll have no tables, no chairs, no water, no busboy, and you'll
      clean it up for 20 minutes after you're finished.&quot; Would you say to
      me, &quot;That's the greatest idea for a business ever heard! We can open
      a chain of these all over the world!&quot; No, you would put me right into
      a sanatorium. Starbucks can only get away with it because they have French
      titles for everything. And I say this with the highest respect, because I
      don't like to talk about people.</font></p>
