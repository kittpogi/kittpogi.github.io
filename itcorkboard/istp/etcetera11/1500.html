                    Next time you are washing your hands and complain because 
                    the water temperature isn't just how you like it, think about 
                    how things used to be.... Here are some facts about the 1500s:</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Most people got married in June because they took their yearly 
                    bath in May and still smelled pretty good by June. However, 
                    they were starting to smell, so brides carried a bouquet of 
                    flowers to hide the body odor. Baths consisted of a big tub 
                    filled with hot water. The man of the house had the privilege 
                    of the nice clean water, then all the other sons <img src="images/medieval01.jpg" alt="medieval knights - &quot;monty python and the holy grail&quot;" width="300" height="185" align="right">and 
                    men, then the women and finally the children-last of all the 
                    babies. By then the water was so dirty you could actually 
                    lose someone in it-hence the saying, &quot;Don't throw the 
                    baby out with the bath water.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Houses had thatched roofs-thick straw, piled high, with no 
                    wood underneath. It was the only place for animals to get 
                    warm, so all the dogs, cats and other small animals (mice 
                    rats, and bugs lived in the roof. When it rained it became 
                    slippery and sometimes the animals would slip and fall off 
                    the roof-hence the saying &quot;It's raining cats and dogs.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house. 
                    This posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other 
                    droppings could really mess up your nice clean bed. Hence, 
                    a bed with big posts and a sheet hung over the top afforded 
                    some protection. That's how canopy beds came into existence. 
                    The floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than 
                    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">dirt, 
                    hence the saying &quot;dirt poor.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    The wealthy had slate floors that would get slippery in the 
                    winter when wet, so they spread thresh on the floor to help 
                    keep their footing. As the winter wore on, they kept adding 
                    more thresh until when you opened the door it would all start 
                    slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed in the entry 
                    way-hence, a &quot;thresh hold.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    They cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle that always hung 
                    over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added things 
                    to the pot. They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much 
                    meat. They would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers 
                    in the pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next 
                    day. Sometimes the stew had food in it that had been there 
                    for quite a while-hence the rhyme, &quot;peas porridge hot, 
                    peas porridge cold, peas porridge in the pot nine days old.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Sometimes they could obtain pork, which made them feel quite 
                    special. When visitors came over, they would hang up their 
                    bacon to show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man &quot;could 
                    bring home the bacon.&quot; They would cut off a little to 
                    share with guests and would all sit around and &quot;chew 
                    the fat.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with a high 
                    acid content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food, 
                    causing lead poisoning and death. This happened most often 
                    with tomatoes, so for the next 400 years or so, tomatoes were 
                    considered poisonous.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    <img src="images/medieval02.jpg" alt="medieval knights - &quot;monty python and the holy grail&quot;" width="250" height="180" align="left">Most 
                    people did not have pewter plates, but had trenchers, a piece 
                    of wood with the middle scooped out like a bowl. Often trenchers 
                    were made from stale paysan bread which was so old and hard 
                    that they could use them for quite some time. </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trenchers 
                    were never washed and a lot of times worms and mold got into 
                    the wood and old bread. After eating off wormy moldy trenchers, 
                    one would get &quot;trench mouth.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt 
                    bottom of the loaf, the family got the middle, and guests 
                    got the top, or &quot;upper crust.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Lead cups were used to drink ale or whiskey. The combination 
                    would sometimes knock them out for a couple of days. Someone 
                    walking along the road would take them for dead and prepare 
                    them for burial. </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They 
                    were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of days and 
                    the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait 
                    and see if they would wake up-hence the custom of holding 
                    a &quot;wake.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    England is old and small and they started out running out 
                    of places to bury people. So they would dig up coffins and 
                    would take the bones to a &quot;bone-house&quot; and reuse 
                    the grave. When reopening these coffins, one out of 25 coffins 
                    were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realized 
                    they had been burying people alive. So they thought they would 
                    tie a string on the wrist of the corpse,lead it through the 
                    coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone 
                    would have to sit out in the graveyard all night (the </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;graveyard 
                    shift&quot;) to listen for the bell; thus, someone could be 
                    &quot;saved by the bell&quot; or was considered a &quot;dead 
                    ringer&quot;.</font></p>
