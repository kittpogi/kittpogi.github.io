                    ITC's early years of service in the University, one would 
                    go to the Miguel Building (then Benilde Building) to knock 
                    on the then Computer Services Center's door. But when I joined 
                    the IT Center in 1996, it was already holding office in Gokongwei 
                    Building and SMO, PRIO, DAO and Docu offices were all housed 
                    at G308 while CFO occupied the present conference room; the 
                    conference room then was just a small area also in G308. During 
                    that time I can still remember one of my first tasks, which 
                    I did not welcome with much enthusiasm, was to go to G309 
                    and have an inventory of pieces of office furniture to be 
                    retained and to forego. G309 would then be our (DAO and Docu) 
                    future office. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
                    time, G309 was a cluttered room, covered with dusts, and lined 
                    with cobwebs. It was in fact a big room partitioned into three 
                    small areas and the main room. The first small room was being 
                    used by Optimum technicians that time (Telectron, who replaced 
                    Optimum still uses that small room at present). The second 
                    small partition was like a receiving area and a passageway 
                    to the main room and the third small room and it was also 
                    used by the Student Assistants as their headquarters. The 
                    third small area was like a storeroom for CFO. The main room, 
                    on the other hand, was like a warehouse for shelves, steel 
                    cabinets, and the other office furniture. </font></p>

                    clearing the room and putting up the cubicles, the room was 
                    already a cross between an office and a mini-warehouse cum 
                    library. The SA's area and the main room was used as the DAO 
                    and Docu Offices and the third small room served as a mini-library 
                    and storeroom as well. Stuffs whose destiny could not be decided 
                    yet were usually confined there. As a matter of fact, several 
                    shelves of old manuals, boxes and all sorts of things (from 
                    obsolete diskettes, video tapes, to spoon, plates, and broken 
                    acoustic guitar) can be found in that room. A total of eight 
                    cubicles were put up in G309 that time although only half 
                    were occupied. But not too long after, the room ended up with 
                    almost all cubicles occupied and even needed to set up another 
                    one to accommodate all the staff. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not 
                    very long when the DAO and Docu staff moved from G308 to the 
                    newly refurbished G309, the CFO people left the present conference 
                    room area and transferred to their present office at G306. 
                    Meanwhile in G308, the mini-conference room area was dismantled 
                    to provide extra space for the SMO and PRIO offices and additional 
                    cubicles were put up. The former CFO area (G307) became the 
                    present ITC Conference Room.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost 
                    six years has transpired and the ITC offices once again underwent 
                    a major reconstruction to accommodate its growing population. 
                    Partitions in G309 were removed except for the small room 
                    for the Telectron technicians. A total of 12 cubicles were 
                    set up, nine were occupied leaving one extra cubicle each 
                    for DAO and Docu offices. One cubicle was dedicated for the 
                    multimedia station of the Docu office. Also, a mini-conference 
                    area was built to augment the conference room reservations. 
                    The DAO and Docu people are still waiting for the completion 
                    of the renovation as the wall cabinets were not yet in place 
                    and other minor aesthetic repairs were not yet done. At the 
                    same time, the cubicles in G308 were replaced and rearranged. 
                    The ITC Secretary's area was also renovated into a counter-type 
                    nook and the furniture in the Director's office was changed 
                    into modular-type to match with the cubicles of other ITC 
                    units. To date, SMO and PRIO people are waiting for the delivery 
                    of their cubicle cabinets and setting up of wall cabinets. 
                    Now, all units of the Center sport the same light gray and 
                    bottle green color of cubicles. Each cubicle has a keyboard 
                    drawer, small hanging cabinets, mobile drawers, and an open 
                    case for the CPUs. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These renovations are expected to accommodate 
                    the growing number of ITC people at least in the next 2-3 
                    years. The new office set up is also expected to provide the 
                    ITPs a suitable environment for productive work and it leaves 
                    each ITP no excuse to practice the 5S principles.</font></p>

                    days before the election, the outgoing officers formulated 
                    a simple guideline for the conduct of the election. During 
                    that meeting, it was deliberated that the new officers should 
                    be a sectoral representative of the units (i.e., one representative 
                    each from DAO, Docu, and PRIO, and two each from SMO and CFO 
                    because of their large number). That equates to each ITP voting 
                    seven persons.</font></p>

                    the election, results were announced and not one of the seven 
                    elected representatives is a Coordinator, as if addressing 
                    the ambivalence of the Coordinators to be voted in any position 
                    since to a certain degree, they are the more senior ITPs and 
                    may also be looked upon as representing the Administration. 
                    Also, the newly voted officers were a mix of junior ITPs and 
                    those not so senior ones. They had their first meeting last 
                    June 14 where they voted among themselves who would fill-in 
                    the key positions of president, vice-president, secretary, 
                    treasurer, grievance officer, and ITP representatives (2).</font></p>

                    their first meeting, the new set of officers discussed the 
                    completion of any pending issues as far as the ITP Assembly 
                    is concerned, and determined the office policies with gray 
                    areas or undefined implementing guidelines. </font></p>

                    other hand, before relinquishing their positions, the outgoing 
                    officers came out with by-laws, duties and responsibilities 
                    of officers, and grievance procedure that could be used by 
                    the incoming officers in the performance of their duties. 
                    And with this, it is expected that the incumbent officers 
                    would be able to deliver more for the welfare of the IT Professionals.</font></p></td>
