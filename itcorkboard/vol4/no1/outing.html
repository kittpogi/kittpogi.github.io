                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Early 
                    morning at ITC, 26th of April, everyone as usual does the 
                    typical work, busy coping up with deliverables and deadlines. 
                    About 7pm, everyone seems to have packed-up their things. 
                    Some went out to dine, some went out to do the last minute 
                    shopping, some took a nap and some simply waited for the time, 
                    time to <img src="images/summer.gif" alt="itc summer shebang 2002" width="250" height="184" align="right">leave 
                    the office and take a two-day holiday out in the sun. It's 
                    summer and each one's raring to go out of town. Take a couple 
                    of days stay at La Union, El Caseron.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Approximately 
                    9:30 in the evening, two L300 canter-type vehicles, estimated 
                    to carry 30 passengers, were outside the parking area. At 
                    first, it seems like it would accommodate 30-35 passengers, 
                    but when everybody, 32 in all, including travel bags, were 
                    already inside, alas, it became jam-packed. It's funny because, 
                    though nobody could move as comfortably as possible, none 
                    seems to be uneasy about it. In the air, there was laughter, 
                    teasing, and a continuity of discourse. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    night was deep and almost everyone was heavy-eyed. The calmness 
                    and stillness of the hour was an invitation for good sleep. 
                    After long hours of travel, these were the words you can hear, 
                    &quot;at last&quot;, &quot;hay&quot;, &quot;finally&quot;, 
                    coz after having traveled maybe 5-6 hours, finally we reached 
                    El Caseron resort, a couple of hours before daybreak. At that 
                    time, we mostly desired of laying our back on the bed to have 
                    a comfortable sleep. The main house has 5 family-size rooms 
                    and two cottages by the seaside. Each room was fully air-conditioned 
                    except for one room in one of the cottages which instead of 
                    being air-conditioned was air-continuous.</font></p>
                  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  few hours after, as you peep through the window, the inviting 
                  waves of the sea glittered from the crystal rays of daylight 
                  and its subtle cool breeze lets you experience an inimitable 
                  rapture. It was indeed surprising to see the house </font> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">conceptualized 
                  in old-fashioned paintings and interior decoration. It was ideal 
                  for group get-together, there were picnic grounds near the shore, 
                  playing area for volleyball, badminton and table tennis, a room

                    After waking from slumber, it was breakfast time, the smell 
                    of hot coffee and traditional meal of tapa, bangus, tocino, 
                    longanisa was enticing. Some woke up late, some were already 
                    on the beach, some were already playing volleyball, some on 
                    the pool and some were watching a movie. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                    daytime, most of the boys had fun with the waves, they swam, 
                    they played, and they would carry every single woman to throw 
                    on the beach. The beach was clean but the shoreline was rocky, 
                    making it difficult for kids to swim. It would require you 
                    to go a depth before you could pass the part where there were 
                    lots of stones. That is why, majority of ladies preferred 
                    to play in the swimming pool. On the pool, everyone was having 
                    fun but what's really amazing is the joy captured on the faces 
                    of children playing on a 2-3 feet high swimming pool. The 
                    delight on their eyes exhibits their appreciation of being 
                    able to swim without apprehension. They swam like they'd never 
                    get tired. They played as if the day would not end. They ran 
                    like babes and hunks in Baywatch not even minding the heat 
                    of the sun and most of all, they would always end up embracing 
                    their parents with tender-loving hugs while in the pool. And 
                    that day, you would hear the finest sound of all&#8230; children's 
                    laughter.</font></p>

                    yet, even adults revert to their childish ways. When the swimming 
                    pool was quarter full, they found pleasure tossing volleyball 
                    and playing team badminton with their faces painted with smiles.

                    for rest. </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
                    the night, it was overwhelming to see boys having their manly

                    in a game of charade while a few decided to watch and have 
                    a movie marathon. For those with families, it was family time. 
                    Some who were dead tired preferred to sleep early. </font></p>

                    next morning, each one made use of every hour left because 
                    the group needed to leave the place after lunch. Everything 
                    that made them enjoy the previous day, and those they haven't 
                    done, they coped by doing these in the early morning. An hour 
                    after lunch, everybody was ready. </font></p>

                    with the people you know. Some said it was comfortable. Some 
                    said though there has been not much of an activity, the door 
                    for relaxation was open. Some said the place was beautiful 
                    except, of course, the rocky seashore. Some were already contented 
                    in the thought that it would be a day out with your colleagues, 
                    some said it was time well spent with their families. But 
                    I guess what counted most was the bonding, being able to know 
                    your second family, as we may say, with their ways and habits. 
                    The place was wonderful and the weather was perfect. It was 
                    a blissful day under the sun, out of air pollution, out of 
                    stress and out of days' work. And how more fulfilling it would
