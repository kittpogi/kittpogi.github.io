                    is envisioned to be a miniature enrollment system. Specifically 
                    geared towards courses offered by offices like College of 
                    Computer Sctudies Consulting and Education Center (CCS CEC) 
                    and CISCO, the system is expected to have a huge impact as 
                    it encompasses all processes from preparation of Statement 
                    of Accounts to ID printing down to the preparation of Certificate 
                    of Completion.</p>
                  <p>The system is still being designed by the Support Systems 
                    Team of SMO, and will be implemented and deployed by next

                    captures the scholarly outputs of the DLSU faculty. This system 
                    was developed in accordance with the requirements of the Office 
                    of the Vice-President for Academics and Research (VPAR). It 
                    will serve as an on-line storage system where faculty members 
                    are required to update personal scholarly data prior to promotion, 
                    reclassification or permanency.</p>
                  <p>Eventually, the VPAR Office can prepare descriptive reports 
                    for strategic planning with ease and assess each faculty member's 
                    strengths and capabilities.</p>

                    the newly-developed <strong>Short-Term Course Registration

                    (CEC), Center for Language Learning (CeLL), and CISCO Networking 
                    Academy for their short-term course offerings. It will mimic 
                    the current manual process flow in that the system will cover 
                    a participant&#8217;s registration, assessment, grade evaluation, 
                    all the way to the printing of certificates. </p>

                  <p>SMO has completed 10 customized reports for the <strong>Oracle

                    all the cost and depreciation of property, plant, and equipment 
                    assets of DLSU. The reports were required for the BIR audit 
                    on the Accounting Department. The group who worked on these 
                    reports included Robert de Jesus, Joel Santiago, Brian Co,

                    At the start of the new year the <strong>Resource Management

                    enable Department Chairs and their secretaries, as well as 
                    student organizations, to make classroom reservations for 
                    their department/organization online. It involves usage tracking 
                    of resources in different locations, the date and time of 
                    the reservation, and the department / organization which made 
                    the reservation. It also monitors the delinquency of a reserving 
                    department for the effective use of the classrooms. </p>

                    has finally been able to meet regularly, i.e. once a week. 
                    The team meets to discuss updates on the Calendar of Operations, 
                    problems encountered, as well as activities that need to be 
                    done based on meetings of the MIS, Operations Council, OUR-ITC, 
                    Enrollment Committees, and others. With the weekly meeting, 
                    the team is able to monitor activities that need to done for 
                    the week, to document activities already done (as well as 
                    reasons for delays in processing), to address concerns raised 
                    in committee meetings, and to refine procedures to better 
                    service the users. <br>

                  <p>MLS-Parent is a system proposed by the Office of the University 
                    Registrar (OUR) which aims to provide up-to-date information 
                    to parents regarding the academic and non-academic status 
                    of their children. The parents will be given usernames and 
                    passwords so they will be able to access the facility which 
                    will be available via the Internet. They will be able to use 
                    this account anytime and anywhere.</p>
                  <p>The system will provide the following options: (1) View Class 
                    Schedule; (2) View Assessment; (3) View Academic Status; (4) 
                    View Discipline Records; and, (5) .View Final Grades</p>
                  <p> <br>
                    The system will be implemented with the parents of the incoming 
                    Freshman of Term 1, SY 2005-2006. The parents of the current 
                    students will be informed about the facility and will be given 
                    until next year to start using the facility. After the one-year 
                    period, the Report of Grades to Parents will no longer be 
                    printed and mailed to the parents.<br>

                  <p> The QA Team has been formed to implement Quality Assurance 
                    in the development of applications. So far, the team has scheduled 
                    trainings on the use of Visual SourceSafe (VSS) for source 
                    control, and on the implementation of QA during program implementation. 
                    The team has started discussing schedules for the drafting 
                    of the UML Standards, and Programming Conventions for PL/SQL. 
                    The team has gone into the design of the Software Development 
                    Monitoring Form, and the Implementation Monitoring Form, e.g. 
                    for monitoring the use of the handbook by the Software Architects, 
                    the implementation of the .Net programming conventions, and 
                    others. The Team is also coordinating with the CFO regarding 
                    the set-up of servers for source control and test environments.<br>
                    <br>
                    The VSS and QA trainings that have been scheduled for December 
                    1 will be from 10-12, at the ITC Conference Room. After the 
                    trainings, the entire SMO team will be undergoing workshops 
                    in the afternoon to ensure that the concepts taught during 
                    the lecture have been understood by the participants. Immediately 
                    after the training, the different system teams -- Student, 
                    Employee and Support -- will be expected to submit their programs 
                    for safekeeping by the Software Librarian, Joel Santiago.<br>
                    <br>
                    The QA Team is composed of Ryan Salvanera, Lorna Acorda, Harold 
                    Bautista, Rowena Santos, Joel Santiago, and Vivian Sy. The 
                    Team meets every Thursday, 1:30-3:30, at the G308 Conference 
                    area.<br>

                    should work on, please feel free to e-mail any member. If 
                    you prefer, you could also join the Team during its weekly
