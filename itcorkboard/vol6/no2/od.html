                  <p><img src="../../vol6/no2/images/money.jpg" width="114" height="76" align="right">When 
                    I presented this to some people in ITC, one question raised 
                    was how we could perform as far as the financial perspective 
                    is concerned. There was no problem regarding the other BSC 
                    perspective &#8211; i.e., customer satisfaction, internal 
                    processes, and organizational learning &#8211; because they 
                    were pretty much self-explanatory. We are seen as a cost center. 
                    We spend money. We do not teach students. As you know, the 
                    student body is the revenue source of the University.</p>
                  <p>The challenge of contributing to the financial performance 
                    of the University is somehow difficult to measure. Perhaps 
                    this is because we do not actually measure this activity even 
                    though we have done several things to save money &#8211; i.e., 
                    doing more with less. One project that we measured was the 
                    satellite dishes used for Internet access. Over a period of 
                    3.25 years, we saved a total of P5 million plus recovery of 
                    purchase cost of two satellite dishes, which amounted to P1.2 
                    million. That&#8217;s a total of P6.2 million.</p>
                  <p>Our automated information systems have enabled the University 
                    to save as well. This covers our programs, electronic records, 
                    web sites, and process improvement projects. We only have 
                    not measured this yet. It is also tedious to measure. Our 
                    programs have improved the productivity of people. They have 
                    helped administrators in making decisions faster as a result 
                    of faster information retrieval. They have enabled the University 
                    to re-assign some people to perform other productive work. 
                    They have improved the image of the University as a technology-enabled 
                    organization. Last but not least, they have helped the University 
                    satisfy its customers. Now, what number can represent the 
                    value in all these?</p>
                  <p>This school year, we again have the opportunity to help the 
                    University save money. This is with the use of a software 
                    called BeTwin. It enables one complete set of computer to 
                    function as two up to five units. We only need to connect 
                    a &#8220;twin&#8221; set &#8211; i.e., a monitor, a keyboard, 
                    a mouse, and speakers via a USB hub. For every deployment 
                    of BeTwin, we can save about P18,000. Using this figure, we 
                    can save P1 million when we deploy 56 units of BeTwin. Assuming 
                    my computations are slightly erratic and the savings is only 
                    P15,000 per deployment. We can save P1 million when we deploy 
                    66 units. If we annualize the savings, it is about P9,000 
                    per deployment per year. Using this figure, we can save P1 
                    million per year if we have 111 deployments. I&#8217;m confident 
                    that we can achieve this. We will even exceed this amount 
                    in the future with the help of BeTwin.</p>
                  <p>I encourage everyone to be more conscious of financial implications 
                    of our projects. I&#8217;m sure that these cost savings will 
                    also give you fulfillment in your work. As someone once told 
                    me, more points in heaven.<br>

                    <strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IT Security</font><br>
                    </strong><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans serif" size="1"><i>By:

                  <p>The Office of the Director is still focused on improving 
                    our IT security as well as PC maintenance service. IT security 
                    is a primary weakness of ITC while the PC maintenance service 
                    is something faculty members have been complaining about.</p>
                  <p>On IT security, we have been making good progress over the 
                    past several months especially on the use of SSL and IPsec 
                    and several server and network management initiatives. Our 
                    next move is to implement SSL on MS Outlook 2003 client with 
                    Exchange 2003. This will not only improve IT security but 
                    also the productivity of our customers. As you know, MS Outlook 
                    client has more functionalities than its web-based counterpart, 
                    OWA. CFO is currently working on some tools to improve our 
                    software patch management capability.</p>
                  <p>On PC maintenance, there were issues raised in the Council 
                    of Deans and Faculty Studies Committee. These were mainly 
                    from the College of Engineering although there were perceptions 
                    that CCS and COS also complained. All these were clarified 
                    already. CCS and COS had no major complaints with our services. 
                    As for COE, the Director had a meeting with five people from 
                    COE representing various COE departments. Again, there were 
                    no major issues raised regarding our services except for three 
                    items related to V103 computer lab. These were either already 
                    resolved or minor problems. The Faculty Studies Committee 
                    has not given a detailed report on their complaint. This means 
                    that their complaints were based merely on perceptions rather 
                    than real issues. Let&#8217;s hope that this is the start 
                    of a good perception/image regarding our PC maintenance services.</p>
                  <p>I would like to thank and congratulate CFO on the various 
                    improvements. We have more things to do but I&#8217;m sure 
                    we&#8217;re already on the right track. Just remember and 
                    do what PRIO teaches &#8211; PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act).</p>
                  <p>Back to IT security, our students, who have problems enabling 
                    their MLS accounts, e-mail our Help Desk with all details 
                    needed (e.g., OR number) and sometimes even with their passwords. 
                    This is dangerous because if there were a hacker/cracker sniffing 
                    the packets of our network or if our e-mail system were compromised, 
                    they could get hold of the passwords and/or details needed 
                    to get the passwords.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    I recently read a short article from W2Knews that a server 
                    of UC Berkeley got compromised. &#8220;A computer hacker accessed 
                    names and Social Security numbers of about 1.4 million Californians 
                    after breaking into a University of California, Berkeley, 
                    computer system in possibly the worst attack of its kind ever 
                    suffered by the school. You need to scan for vulnerabilities 
                    the moment they come out, and patch 'em like greased lightning.&#8221;</p>
                  <p><br>
                    We need to research to continue improving the security and 
                    quality of our automated information systems and databases. 
                    In terms of processes, I hope that we&#8217;ll be able to 
                    implement the system code and system documentation repository 
                    procedures. I&#8217;m sure everyone will pitch in.<br>
