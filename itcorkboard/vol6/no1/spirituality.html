                  <p>What do you do to search for God? Unfortunately, there is 
                    no formula in finding God, but the good news is that God is 
                    searching for you - and he wants you to find Him. Here are 
                    a few ideas to help you in your search for God. </p>
                  <p><b><img src="images/searching.jpg" alt="searching god" width="185" height="244" align="right">Pray. 
                    </b> Ask God to help you find him. Ask him to show you Himself 
                    even if you're unsure He's there. Prayer is simply talking 
                    honestly with God from your heart. Tell Him you're looking 
                    for Him. As you search, tell Him your questions, thoughts, 
                    doubts, fears and hopes. </p>
                  <p><b>Focus your search on Jesus. </b> What is God like? What 
                    is His character? We can find the most tangible picture of 
                    who God is in the person of Jesus. A letter from one of Jesus' 
                    followers writes, "He is the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 
                    1:15). When we look at Jesus we see the God who cannot be 
                    seen.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thelife.com/aboutjesus/" target="_blank">Investigating 
                    Jesus </a>- his character and claims - will lead you to God. 
                  </p>
                  <p><a href="http://www.thelife.com/thebook/complex_intro.html" target="_blank"><strong>Read 
                    the Bible.</strong> </a> The Bible is a book of people's search 
                    and relationship with God throughout history. It is also the 
                    most direct way to gain a clear picture of God in looking 
                    at the person of Jesus, because everything in the Bible points 
                    to Jesus. </p>
                  <p><b>Engage your brain... </b> Embarking on a spiritual search 
                    doesn't mean you have to turn your brain off. As author Brian 
                    McLaren writes in his book <i>Finding Faith</i>, "Though healthy 
                    faith is bigger than the intellect, the search for faith cannot 
                    bypass the intellect.&quot; This is a journey that will require 
                    you to think bigger than you ever have before and then to 
                    think bigger still." Ask questions. Look at your discoveries 
                    - does it make reasonable sense? Knowing God shouldn't be 
                    illogical. </p>
                  <p><b>...but search with all your heart. </b> On the other hand, 
                    don't leave your heart behind either. God doesn't want you 
                    to merely find out <i>about </i> Him, He wants you to <i>actually 
                    find Him</i> - He wants you to&nbsp;know Him personally and 
                    have a relationship with Him. A relationship that involves 
                    intellect with no heart is no relationship at all. </p>
                 <p><b>Know your past and stay open to what you're looking for. </b> Our past influences the way
                  we see and understand things in our present and future experiences. Know your past experiences
                  and presuppositions - the things you currently believe. These will profoundly affect your search
                  for God. Just as we are reminded from a scene in <i>The Passion of the Christ </i> where Pontius
                  Pilate and his wife Claudia discuss truth, we won't be able to recognize the truth if we aren't
                  open to hearing it. </p>
                  <p><b>Ask questions</b>. Question things that people seem to 
                    take for granted. Anything true or worth pursuing should be 
                    able to stand up against tough cross examination. Write down 
                    your questions, especially about the Bible and Jesus. Where 
                    can you ask and discuss your questions? Talk with people you 
                    know who follow Jesus (maybe the person who brought you to 
                    see <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>). Join a <a href="http://alphacourse.org/default.htm" target="_blank">discussion 
                    group </a> in your area that explores&nbsp;God and Jesus.&nbsp;Express

                  <p><b>Investigate and read. </b> See what others have to say 
                    by reading articles, books, the Bible and web sites. Ask people 
                    who follow Jesus what books and resources they have found 
                    helpful in getting a clearer picture of Jesus and God.&nbsp; 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Talk to people who love and follow Jesus.</b> Get to know 
                    people who show evidence of living according to a different 
                    set of principles. Ask how they discovered Jesus. How did 
                    they search? Why do they believe? How do they continue to 
                    discover more and develop their relationship with God? </p>
                  <p><b>Journal </b> <strong>your thoughts, questions, discoveries 
                    and new insights.</strong> Think of it as a scrapbook of your 
                    spiritual journey.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p><b>Spend time in nature. </b> A letter from one of Jesus' 
                    followers explains the value of observing and experiencing 
                    God's creation."By taking a long and thoughtful look at what 
                    God has created, people have always been able to see what 
                    their eyes as such can't see: eternal power, for instance, 
                    and the mystery of His divine being." (Romans 1:20) </p>
                  <p><b>Make time for your search for God. </b> The unseen and 
                    spiritual things in our lives are easily crowded out by the 
                    many things that urgently grab our attention. Decide when 
                    you'll take a few practical steps - read a book, spend an 
                    hour searching on-line, find someone to talk to. Give yourself 
                    a general time frame to search - then draw some initial conclusions 
                    you can act on. </p>
                  <p><b>Evaluate and respond. </b> There will come times when 
                    you need to react to what you discover about Jesus. What do 
                    you think of who He says He is? Is it true? How will you respond? 
                    Remember that you don't have to know everything about something 
                    to know it, especially if that "something" is as vast as God! 
                    Even if you searched for evidence of God your whole lifetime, 
                    at some point, finding God will involve an element of faith. 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Expect ongoing questions</b><strong> and doubts along 
                    the way.</strong> Finding God certainly doesn't mean having 
                    the answers to all your questions immediately. Questions are 
                    a natural and necessary part of your spiritual journey and 
                    growth, whether you are just beginning to search for God or 
                    you already ound Him years ago. There are a million discoveries 
                    about God that are yet to come. </p>
                  <p><strong>As you search for God, </strong><b>know that you 
                    are not the only one searching. </b> Jesus is searching for 
                    you and wants you to find Him. In His own words Jesus says: 
                    "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; 
                    knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who 
                    asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, 
                    the door will be opened." (Matthew 7:7) </p>
