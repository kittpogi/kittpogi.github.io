                    of the major changes that occurred this school year is the 
                    transfer of the College of Computer Studies (CCS) and the 
                    Information Technology Center (ITC) to De La Salle University-Manila 
                    (DLSU-M) from the Professional Schools, Inc. (PSI). Now, the 
                    lone component of PSI is the Graduate School of Business (GSB). 
                  </p>
              <p>The transfer presents many questions, as far as ITC is concerned. One, will ITC have our own
                   ITP Manual or will we be incorporated with the existing DLSU-Manila Faculty Manual? Second,
                   if the ITP Manual is integrated with the DLSU-Manila Manual, will we have our own section? Third,
                   should we join the Faculty Association? How much will ITC gain or lose if we do? It is also
              timely that the transfer coincided with the bargaining for the Faculty Manual. </p>
                  <p>On the lighter side, now, we have to prove our athletic prowess 
                    if we want to show our mettle in the annual faculty sports 
                    fest. </p>
                  <p>Come to think of it, we ITPs have shown our flexibility in coping up with the changing times.
                   We take it to heart when we say continuous improvement. At times, we also show the different
                   campuses that we set the example for our contemporaries, especially in the information technology
                  field.</p>

                  <p>The officers are guided with the thrust &#8220;Transparency 
                    through information dissemination&#8221;. The minutes of the 
                    officers' meetinsg are posted for every body to give comments 
                    on before the approval of the minutes in the next meeting. 
                    Everyone is also encouraged to give inputs for the agenda 
                    of the meeting. </p>
                  <p>The focus of the meetings is the formulation of proposals 
                    for the coming Faculty Manual negotiations. The effectivity 
                    of the current ITC Manual under PSI is until this school year. 
                    Many ITPs contribute proposals. The merit of these ideas is 
                    deliberated in the meeting and the rationale for proposing 
                    them are drafted. CMQ is tasked to represent the ITPs in the 
                    actual negotiation. In cases where CMQ is unavailable to attend, 
                    RTD will be official substitute. - by <em>Catalina M. Quiogue</em></p>

                  <p><strong>Delford S. Gamayo</strong><br>
                    I started working here in De La Salle University last Sept 
                    8, 2003 as Lab Assistant. I was so glad to work here because 
                    all the faculties, staff and some of the students I met are 
                    very friendly. But when I started as PC Engineer of ITC-CFO, 
                    I can&#8217;t express what I feel because another happiness 
                    in my life happened that time. Being a part of the team was 
                    my dream even when I was still a Lab Assistant. Sir Boyet 
                    introduced me to all of the ITC staff and they all welcomed 
                    me as a new member of the team. I&#8217;m hoping that this 
                    would be the first and last company I&#8217;ll be working 
                    for because all the ITC Staff are very supportive to each 
                    other. And I promised to myself to do my best, to do all my 
                    tasks and responsibilities as part of the team.</p>
                  <p><strong>Arnel Roland T. Garing</strong><br>
                    I&#8217;m really thankful for being given the chance to be 
                    a PC Engineer here in De La Salle University but, first, I&#8217;m 
                    also thankful for being given the opportunity to be a Computer 
                    Laboratory Assistant. It really helped me a lot to improve 
                    my talents and skills, and to improve my social life. It was 
                    a great moment in my life. And now, as a PC Engineer here 
                    in ITC, I consider it as a new great moment in my life. Why? 
                    Because of all the good and supporting members of the Center. 
                    They keep on helping me in improving my weakness. They are 
                    always there to support me. Thanks, thanks, thanks. In return, 
                    I will not waste your efforts. I will do all my best to contribute, 
                    support and attain our goals in ITC. As a group, you can lean 
                    on me. I hope our relationship inside the team will stay the 
                    same forever.</p>
                  <p><strong>Rhamille T. Golimlim</strong><br>
                    After having been contracted for a project with the DLSU Central 
                    Purchasing Station, I have personally felt how it is to be 
                    a part of, and work with ITC even before I start working here 
                    as an employee. That experience made me feel intimidated as 
                    well as challenged with the professionalism and dedication 
                    showed by its employees. When I was informed that ITC is giving 
                    me an opportunity to work with them, I was hesitant at first 
                    for the reason that I was somewhat afraid that my young career 
                    would be out of their league, but then again, when I thought 
                    that this kind of opportunity on working with a very conducive 
                    environment, great people to work with, a very good career 
                    path ahead and the stability of the institution itself, from 
                    that point on, I knew that I made a right choice. It would 
                    be my privilege to be a part of this team and to be able to 
                    contribute in achieving the goal of the institution. Clearly 
                    ITC is not just a place for us to grow onto but eventually 
                    for it to grow into each and everybody.</p>

                    It has been a welcome change to get out of the corporate world 
                    and back into the academe. Noisy corridors, younger crowds, 
                    casual clothes, drinking fountains, student prices, etc... 
                    Add the fact that I know a couple of ITC people from past 
                    climbs, the transition has been smooth and working here has 
                    been enjoyable. So far, so good. </p>
                  <p><strong>Jason D. Valenzuela</strong><br>
                    First of all, I&#8217;d like to thank our Lord GOD for answering 
                    my prayers, to work in a prestigious company, (DLSU, of course) 
                    where it has good &amp; nice employees, a pleasant environment, 
                    friendly and supportive co-employees. I cannot ask for anything 
                    more having had a prayer like this answered. Counting my service 
                    as Computer Lab Technician, I have been employed in this company 
                    for one year. Wow! I enjoy it. I&#8217;m learning a lot of 
                    things enriching my work experience. Plus, it&#8217;s nice 
                    to be back in a learning environment with others who share 
                    similar background. I greatly appreciate the quality of work 
                    that DLSU has offered me. Everybody is easy to work with and 
                    professional in every way. I hope our professional experience 
                    continues for a long time. GODSPEED everyone. Thanks again.</p>
